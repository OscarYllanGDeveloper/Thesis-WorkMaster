einstein's field equations episode 5.1 welcome everybody to this
0:20
fresh new episode on youtube videos uh which i'm making on einstein's field
0:25
equations well i have mentioned this episode to be episode 5.1 because there will be
0:32
two parts of this episode which deals with components of einstein's field equations
0:37
now as you can see on the right hand side of the screen i will be specifically speaking and explaining about these
0:44
three concepts the richie curvature tensor the richie scalar and the stress energy momentum tensor
0:52
so there will be another episode followed by this one which will be episode 5.2 where we will
0:59
take all these components into accounts so this is the first episode dealing with einstein's field
1:05
equations well before i start my video i would like to
1:11
express my sincere thanks to all those subscribers who have commented and expressed their thanks and has been
1:18
a source of motivation i am especially thankful to randy martin who has
1:24
suggested to keep the background sound to be as low as possible i try to make a video previous to this
1:31
which which has a background sound but it is really disturbed a lot so randy i have put up the entire
1:38
background video so that the explanation is much clearer thanks to twinkle pal who has
1:44
uh been motivating me and she watches the lectures cosmo philosophy and science who has
1:50
been a source of motivation and he or she comments on my videos
1:55
and to prabhal who has expressed thank you so a big thanks to all of you who has
2:01
subscribed and commented and expressed their interest in my channel
2:06
physics for students so we would be dealing primarily with the components of
A quick recap (From the previous video)
2:12
einstein's field equations as you can see this is basically the expanded form of einstein's field
2:18
equations so we would start with r mu nu which is the richie curvature tensor
2:24
we will also deal with the single r richie curvature scalar the g mu nu which is the metric tensor
2:31
lambda which is the cosmological constant the capital g which is the good old
2:36
newton's gravitational constant and c which is the speed of light followed by t
2:42
mu nu which is the stress energy momentum tensor well in this particular video we would
2:47
be taking r mu new which is a rishi curvature tensor followed by the richie curvature scalar and t mu nu which is
2:55
the stress energy momentum tensor rest of the part metric tensor gravitational constant
3:00
the speed of light as well as t 8 pi g we will take uh into account in the
3:07
coming videos otherwise it will be too lengthy to explain in a single video
3:15
so first let us note that what does this greek symbol immune denote well as we all know that
3:22
these greek symbols are used to denote some kind of uh indices or
3:27
anything related to tensor so mu nu in this einstein field equation uh mu nu can be used for
3:34
different purpose but particularly to this context it denotes space time in four dimensions
3:40
so uh the first zero would be the time factor one the x-axis to the y-axis and three
3:47
the z-axis so you can see these are the spatial dimensions which are measured by mu nu
3:53
and zero being the time now if i try to plot this entire mu new concept in an x y
3:59
axis we i am i am not taking into account the z axis because it would be difficult to
4:04
show so this t would be the time which is shown on the y axis and x y z are the three spatial dimensions
4:12
and this one is the time and x y z z would be the space so mu nu basically denotes the space
4:19
time in four dimensions which is used extensively in einstein's field equations
4:28
now we know uh as you have observed me that i have been speaking about einstein's field equations using a
4:36
plural however einstein uh the single equation is seems to be a single equation however
4:42
these are not a single equation it consists of 16 non-linear partial differential
4:48
equations in a spherical or you can say in different coordinate system so uh let us see how what makes up the
4:56
16 uh partial or pdes so our mu new uh as we have noted mu new denotes four
5:02
dimensions of space time the g mu nu again another four dimension we have a repetition of g mu new so it
5:09
takes up another four dimension and the stress tensor team you know taking up four dimension so together they make up 16 equations
5:16
but note right on the bottom of the screen i have written six equations a duplicate
5:22
so this makes them a total of 10 non-linear partial differential equations
5:27
so 16 are the equations we deduct those six equations and we reduce it to ten non-linear pdes
5:35
so in the coming few slides i will be showing what are the duplicate equations or rather i will say what are the
5:40
duplicate components which actually leads to 10 differential equations instead of
5:46
16. so this actually shows the 16 equations if we consider the mu nu which are the
5:52
dimension of space and time now we all know from our basic linear
5:58
algebra course which you have done in our school days that what is a symmetric matrix so we take into account this
6:04
simple three by three matrix where i have circled one two and three and if i transpose it it
6:10
would lead to this so you all know what is a symmetric matrix so on the on on the uh with whatever the code uh
6:17
numbers that you consider what is on the horizontal if you transpose it it lies the same so there is no change so this is
6:24
what is a basic definition of a symmetric matrix you might be thinking why i'm doing so it will just become clear
6:30
in a few more minutes when i would be explaining on this so we should note that metric tensor is
6:37
basically a symmetric tensor in your screen you can see the expanded part of the metric tensor which is
6:43
starts from g00 and it goes up to g33 and this is four by four so it takes up
6:49
a total of 16 components so but among these few of them are common so you see g01 and g10
6:57
marked in red are common g02 and g20 again is common g zero three and g three zero are common
7:04
so by the term common it doesn't it actually means that they might carry different value but if we take these
7:11
into accounts these are cons these can be deducted from the metric tensor so if we go on like this g 0 1 g 1 0
7:19
g 0 2 g 2 0 g 0 3 equals to g 3 0 and if we continue like this we get
7:26
a symmetric tensor that means the components g mu nu equals to g new mu
7:32
so it is evident from this that if we continue discarding the duplicate
7:37
components from this tensor it leads to a symmetric tensor
7:44
so these are the 10 components of the metric tensor when we reduce them from 16 so you can see
Components of Einstein's field equations
7:51
on the top 4 plus 3 plus 2 plus 1 and also note one thing that all these
7:57
components in this geometric that is the metric tensile all are unique that means there is no
8:03
duplicate among the components and this leads to the 10 components of the metric tensor
8:08
so by now what we have learned is that we have learned that how we are reducing the 16 components of a tensor to
8:14
10 components and we are eliminating those which are common
8:20
similarly if we consider the t mu nu which is a stress energy momentum tensor we will see that this also reduces to
8:27
10. this is the complete team you knew that it is a complete stress energy tensor
8:32
so t 0 1 t 1 0 t 0 2 2 t 2 0 t 0 t and 3 0. in this similar way
8:39
which we did in metric tensor if we continue eliminating those components then what
8:45
it would finally leave is that this one so t mu nu would now become equal to t nu mu
8:53
which is again a symmetric tensor so uh the stress energy momentum tensor we deduce we reduce the six components
9:01
in the tumor unit that is the stress energy momentum tensor we reduce the uh the the common components
9:08
so this is what it is you see on the left hand side of the screen it is just similar to the metric tensor gmu
9:14
new and all you can see here all the components are unique and this leads to the 10 components of
9:21
stress energy momentum tensor so this actually shows that how we can reduce
9:26
the duplicate components from uh metric tensor to stress energy momentum tensor and it leads to ten
9:32
components now let us summarize quickly what we learned about the einstein field
Summarizing
9:37
equation this is uh the complete uh field equations written over there now if you consider from r mu nu to
9:44
lambda g mu nu which i have marked it in red this is actually which shows the
9:49
curvature of space time as determined by the metric g now uh we would be explaining about the concept of
9:56
metric tensor but for for for the moment just to understand that we are trying to measure
10:01
something so measurement relates to metric which we denote by small g right so this part which i have shown in
10:09
red leads to the curvature of space time and how do we measure it we measured it by the metric which is d
10:15
further it redu it goes to geometry of space time so the left hand side
10:21
it is basically the geometry of space time which is determined by the metric g
10:26
on the right hand side which i have marked in blue you can see this is actually the matter energy
10:31
content of space time that means what whatever be the amount of matter the the components related to matter
10:39
everything is everything is explained on the right hand side this actually leads to the matter movement
10:45
that means anything any matter which is moving through space time and both the geometry of space time and
10:51
the matter movement is being equal so i believe this gives you a clear picture how geometry
10:58
of space and matter movement are related to each other so the curvature which leads to the
11:04
geometry equals to the matter content and it equals to the matter movement and
11:10
that is why the left-hand side of the efe einstein field equation equals to the right hand side
11:15
we will soon see and things will become much clearer
11:22
now we can alternatively write the einstein field equation in this way so we can take the r menu till half of
Alternative way of writing the equation
11:30
our g mu nu and we can uh summarize that as g mu du as we will see this is
11:37
basically the einstein tensor component once we uh shorten it like this
11:42
this can be written as when we are substituting the g mu new value right on the top which is
11:48
marked in red we get g mu nu plus the rest of the factors followed by a kappa term which we are
11:53
coming this one marked in blue actually shows you that this red marked
11:59
a part of the equation the left hand side the two factors can be reduced and written in this way
12:05
now this eight pi g uh whole divided by c 4 t mu du is basically the kappa term
12:12
we will later deal into what this is actually all about this is more or less equivalent to the
12:18
value that you are seeing 2.700 and this is basically the einstein
12:24
gravitational constant right so uh what i can tell you from here is that
12:29
this c raised to the power four is basically taken as a speed of light
12:34
in four dimensions uh we which we will come in the later part of the later into another video uh the
12:41
g is the gravitational constant newton's gravitational constant and 8 pi this pi factor is actually
12:48
coming when we are computing the the surface area of a sphere so we will see into
12:55
that it actually comes from poison's equation of gravity how the gravitational force is taken
13:01
into account i'm not going into this right now so these are the components 8 pi factor comes from poisons equation
13:08
and computation on its spherical surface g is the gravitational constant newton t mu nu we will deal with this
13:15
video and c to the raised to the power 4 is basically the dimension part of the speed of light so
13:20
here you see that 8 pi g is basically a constant so that we can recover
13:25
newton's law of of gravities for small and static masses
13:33
now yes so einstein tensor is defined by this which is right in front of your screen
13:38
uh g-menu as we know it is the einstein tensor and the einstein's tensor as we have
13:45
seen is symmetric just like other tensor and it is representing the space-time
13:50
curvature of this curvature is basically due to matter distribution
13:55
which follows through space and time and in fact the so-called gravitational force is nothing
14:00
but it is the curvature which lets matter move so this is basically a kind of a concept where we are
14:07
rephrasing the einstein field equation into einstein tensor we will soon see what is the advantage
14:13
of this well you need to know another thing that einstein tensor has zero divergence that
14:19
means if you take into fluid mechanics uh divergent zero means whatever fluid is coming inside
14:25
the amount of fluid is going out i have just written this in partial differential form so that it
14:30
gives you a kind of a nice recap so now you might be it might be going in
14:35
your mind that the significance of einstein tensor having a zero divergence so you see g mu nu we have already seen
14:43
is actually providing a curvature of space time tmu new actually presents
14:49
of energy and mass so and we know that these two are equal so the beauty of the zero
14:54
divergence is this so you see g mu nu which is einstein tensor plus the lambda and the other
15:00
term equals to the kappa term followed by the stress energy momentum tensor now because we have seen that einstein
15:08
tensor have a zero divergence so the left hand side has to be equal to something on the
15:14
right hand side because the books need to balance so the law of conservation has to balance so that is
15:19
why you see on the right hand side which is written in red i have written that it has got a zero
15:25
divergence to match the law of energy conservation so because the einstein tensor have got
15:30
a zero divergence why it has got a zero divergence i won't go into the mathematical derivation it
15:37
equals to the uh stress energy momentum sensor so that these two are balancing with the
15:42
law of cons law of energy conservation now the covariant derivative as we have
15:49
seen those who are not ever what is covariant derivative you can just understand that
15:54
the ordinary derivative which we take uh is not working in riemannian manifold so we take
16:00
something which is called a covariant derivative well this is not an exact definition however i will make another video on
16:07
what is the significance of covariance derivative however in this particular video understand that covariant derivative of
16:14
einstein tensor is set to zero and its connection with the stress tensor is defined by this term now this here
16:21
you can see there is a gamma term which is used as a coefficient connection use defined in the matrix now
16:28
here we can say that that einstein tensor has zero divergence ensuring the conver uh energy conservation of matter now the
16:36
curvature of space time which is induced by the presence of matter that is the energy momentum tensor
16:42
that means in a it is a four dimensional version of the stress tensor you know that in fluid mechanics which describes
16:49
the pressure fluid now the newton's law of motion can be expressed as the vanishing of the
16:54
divergence of the stress tensor this generalizes to minkowski space which we know
17:00
where in addition to pressure we have something which we call energy and its flux now
17:06
one thing is quite clear till now what we have discussed that when we proceed from space time to a curved space time
17:13
we have to replace this one which you see on the left hand side derivative followed by this
17:18
reverse uh what you call this reverse delta which is called the greek letter nabla
17:24
so this is is uh you know changed it is replaced by a covariant derivative so hence whatever
17:32
is on the other side of the equation it must have a vanishing diverges so that you understand by this time the
17:39
zero divergence of the stress tensor which we showed earlier comes from the requirement of the conservation of
17:45
matter and energy and after formulating the einstein field equation it follows that the left hand
17:51
side which was einstein tensor must have a zero divergence in order to meet
17:56
with the uh right hand side that is the stress tensor so let us make a quick summary what we
18:03
have learned the vanishing of the divergence of einstein's tensor is the same what we got as the
18:09
divergence of the energy momentum tensor the physical reason why we get the vanishing of
18:14
divergence is basically the energy conservation and it is most natural for the generalization of curve space time
18:21
we have also seen that the long einstein field equation can be written in a much more shorter way
18:27
and this can be regarded as a consequence of the fact that the theory must be independent of choice of
18:33
coordinates if you have seen my earlier video where i have in the in the in the curvature space time i
18:39
have told that general theory of relativity doesn't deal with even any coordinate system
18:44
it picks up arbitrary places in the manifold so we need to get hold of something which
18:49
is independent of the choice of coordinates so now you see i we can summarize this
18:56
einstein tensor should be equal to on the right hand side which is a stress energy momentum
19:02
tensor
Stress energy momentum tensor, curvature & matter
19:07
okay so we now come to the next part of the video what do we mean now we have seen that
19:13
the curvature of space time is basically uh for the reason it has got matter now
19:18
if i may ask you that what is matter what causes the constituents of matter you would say
19:24
it is mass right but we you know we have moved out from the newtonian
19:29
concept of mass and the when we moved into relative relativistic concept of mass
19:35
where we have seen that there are a lot of other concepts called relativistic mass rest mass etc so what i'm trying to tell you is
19:43
that from newtonian concept when we are moving into specialty of relativity and further we are generalizing into
19:49
general theory of relativity the lot of components which actually makes up a matter
19:55
it is just not the mass it is just not the rest mass it contains uh you know relativistic
20:01
mass rest mass and lot of things so we actually need a whole catalog of you know components which would
20:08
actually describe mass so here is the simple question what
20:13
consists of uh matter which causes space time now here on your screen you see i have
20:19
uh simply written the equation which is the relativistic mass this is what is called the total
20:26
energy of a mood moving body which is uh which is given from the lorenz boost of the uh special theory of
20:33
relativity now if once this consists of uh mass so what are the things what are the
20:40
essential essential constituents which makes up matter so you see i have written down
20:45
energy density momentum flow of energy pressure and stress so
20:52
all these six components actually now makes up what we call matter so the energy momentum
20:59
tensor in physics this describes the local distribution of mass momentum and energy we will soon see so
21:06
that this is basically uh a kind of uh understanding that from newtonian mechanics
21:11
moving to relativity and further to general relativity it is not so simple to define matter or
21:17
mass it actually contains lot of things so we need to have a concrete picture
21:22
picture in which we can plug in all those components so for example in two dimension i have
21:28
got this so you see i have got a two by two matrix and the red one is the energy density
21:35
the purple one is the momentum density and the green one is the pressure for example we get it this in two dimension
21:42
now what happens if i expand this into four dimension on the bottom right hand side of the
21:47
screen you see this is a complete four by four matrix and you have got dimensions t x
21:54
y and z if you remember right at the beginning we told we we i told you that uh in the
22:00
einstein field equation we are measuring space time in four dimension which is uh denoted by the greek letter
22:07
mu and u so this is actually the stress energy momentum tensor so this two dimension gets expanded into
22:14
four dimension how we are going to explain you one by one
22:20
now in two dimension let us take this purple part okay this is considered to be momentum
22:26
density don't worry i will be explaining you or the definition of momentum density and ignore if you already know one
22:32
so those marked in red if it contains momentum density now if i expand this momentum density
22:38
into three dimensions you see this comes this on the right hand side so you see on the top you have three coordinate
22:45
system x y and z which has been further given into three by three matrix so
22:50
what i'm trying to do over here is that i am considering a fictitious kind of a matrix two by two
22:57
where i'm taking the momentum density in two dimension and i'm expanding it to three dimensions
23:06
now for example i get further from this t by t axis i go into this t
23:12
x x t sub x x which is we call is the pressure part now if i expand it further then you see
23:20
again we get something like this x y and z and this is actually what we
23:25
called is pressure so earlier you have the seen the momentum density getting expanded
23:31
pressure is further getting expanded into three uh into three components of a tensor
23:39
and you have got this so there are one two three four five six other components so just to
23:47
take a note in between you must we must note that because general theory of relativity deals with
23:53
positions which are arbitrary in the manifold we must take into account a tensor why
23:59
because if you have seen my earlier video in tensor it actually explain uh explains that
24:04
things are invariant okay things are not varying only the uh the basis of the vectors are changing
24:12
so we need to have something which is invariant under coordinate transformation when we are moving from an euclidean to non
24:19
non-euclidean place space so here on your screen on the right hand side you see the stress energy momentum tensor
24:27
you we note that although we call this as stress energy momentum tensor it is
24:32
nothing but the extension of the classical stress tensor which we know in
24:37
newtonian mechanics it is a relativistic extension it actually describes the momentum flux
24:43
through space-time and most importantly it gives rise to whatever you call gravity and general relativity so here
24:51
is the space time vector uh space time 4 vector which is defined by this r is vector which is pointing towards
24:58
this 4 and the energy momentum vector which is defined by e let us go forward and see what this
25:05
energy momentum for vector is defined as so this one if we consider it the e uh
25:11
denotes the energy which is from the einstein's field equation e equals m c squared then we
25:17
got momentum in x direction we got the momentum in y direction and we got the momentum in z direction so
25:23
this is basically the uh the expansion of the newtonian stress energy tensor
25:30
into relativistic stretch stress energy tensor but
25:35
yeah so this is just a vector which can be written in the form of a row but what we are looking is we are
25:41
looking for a tensor why we are looking for a tensor because we need to find out a component
25:46
which is invariant in coordinate transformation when we are moving from a euclidean uh space to a
25:53
non-euclidean space so here on your screen is what we call is a stress energy momentum tensor
26:00
now we are going to explain it uh one by one but you see on the left hand side you see t00 which
26:06
is the energy density this t01 to 203 is the energy flux
26:11
and on the left hand side you see the momentum density so just to give you a uh clarity that any
26:17
part of energy that we are thinking anything that we that we can visualize
26:22
as an energy it can be pure energy rest mass relativistic mass stress whatever it finds somewhere a
26:30
home this is the house so somewhere it finds a kind of a resting place in the home and this is what uh what the stress
26:38
energy momentum tensor uh consists of now you see on the left hand
26:43
side this t00 which is the energy density it will always predominate the energy
26:49
tensor why because energy as we know from einstein's field equation equals
26:54
m equals to m c squared and here it goes i have marked it in red c square because
27:00
the magnitude of the velocity of the light is so huge that is the reason that energy density will always
27:07
be predominant factor and that is why it is right on the time part of the stress energy
27:12
momentum tensor the first component of the tensor so because of the uh magnitude of the speed of light it
27:19
will always be the always be predominant now if i go for the meaning of the terms
27:26
just a quick recap energy density as you know it is the amount of energy stored in a given system
27:31
per unit volume so it is get per length cubed energy flux is something which is called
27:37
uh you know a rate of transfer where energy is moving through a surface momentum
27:42
density it is there on the screen i have just given a kind of a equation it is not true here but it is
27:48
the it is true in the electromagnetic wave field the momentum per unit volume we get the pressure term uh which is f
27:55
by upon a and we get shear tr stress which is denoted by the tau symbol which is the force applied whole divided
28:02
by the cross sectional area which is uh denoted by m squared so these are the quick
28:07
four five terms which we went earlier so these are the meaning of the terms
28:15
now in the stress energy momentum tensor if you see on the uh right on the right hand side we will
28:21
deal first with the energy density so you see the energy that is responsible for the curvature of space
28:27
time we have already shown a kind of an intuitive approach that because mass
28:32
equals to energy and because energy equals to m c squared so definitely the energy would
28:39
be responsible for the mass which is responsible for the curvature of space-time
28:45
we deal with pressure also so i have give given a small icon where a hand is squeezing an object so if we
28:52
squeeze an object hard it can deform the surface so this deformation is something which
28:58
we called uh the is responsible for curving the space time so pressure
29:03
also acts as a source of space-time curvature energy flux will uh it is something
29:09
analogous to uh you can think that um when you're sitting in front of a window and uh the la the sun rays are
29:16
streaming from the window direct directly to you so this this this flow of the sunlight
29:22
is something which we call the flux or you can call energy flux so movement of matter
29:28
uh say from one place to another if i roll a ball from one place to another it causes some energy to transfer from
29:34
one place to another so this energy transfer from one place to another is what is called energy flux
29:40
so automatically energy flux because it is related to matter it is something which causes the
29:45
space-time curvature so energy density followed by the pressure followed by energy flux
29:52
now we are left with another factor which is called the momentum density so i have just given a basic equation
29:58
momentum flow equals to mass flow multiplied by momentum or mass so energy and momentum because they're
30:04
closely related to each other momentum actually plays a pivotal role in the space-time curvature
30:10
so all these factors actually now you see energy plus momentum plus pressure plus
30:17
stress actually makes up this blue area which is the matter and this matter causes a
30:22
dent or it causes a curvature in space time so this actually concludes our
30:28
discussion or it actually shows how the stress energy momentum tensor and how the
30:34
components of this tensor are contributing to the fact of matter and eventually curving the
30:40
space time so here you see energy momentum pressure
30:46
and stress it contributes to making up the stress tensor denoted by t mu nu which is also a zero divergent
30:54
tensor so it leads to zero divergence and don't worry about this this is basically what we have
31:00
uh we find that when we use the covariant derivative how the zero divergence happen and it is
31:06
energy not mass that is the source of gravity now obviously one question comes into
31:12
the mind which i was also thinking so it is good time to take a note that if the zero
31:18
divergence of stress energy momentum tensor uh leads to the conservation of the
31:23
energy energy energy then can we tell that zero divergence of stress tensor is
31:29
responsible for the conservation of energy it's an obvious question
31:34
the answer actually is no the answer is no actually what happens i
31:39
will tell you the zero divergence of the stress energy momentum tensor does not directly
31:44
imply the energy conservation rather it implies indirectly now as i told you earlier that when we
31:51
are considering a manifold especially in general theoretical relativity we are not using the vanishing
31:58
divergence in the ordinary uh i would say in the ordinary sense or the ordinary
32:03
derivatives so the covariant derivative divergence involved implies implies vanishing divergence in one
32:09
coordinates frame which implies vanishing in all other coordinate system so to show every momentum conservation
32:16
we have to include the energy momentum of gravitational field and then conserve
32:21
divergence and it is just the ordinary divergence similarly in charge conservation in young males
32:29
vanishing gorge converge covariant divergence of the matter field holds in all frames of reference that is
32:35
it is gorge invariant but the change of matter is not conserved since the gauge bosons also carry charge
32:42
now you have to take into account gauge boson charges and then show the ordinary
32:47
divergence of the combined matter along with the field current and then it vanishes so
32:53
just to make things easier on a note that the ordinary divergence does not vanish it is the
32:59
covariant divergence which vanishes so in order to vanish and make it equal
33:04
to the law of conservation of energy we have to first make zero divergence of the ordinary
33:12
divergence and then only one frame of reference will be equal to the another frame of reference so if this is
33:18
not the right way to say that zero divergence is responsible for conservation of energy no because the
33:24
ordinary divergent doesn't vanish it is only that the covariant divergence
33:36
vanishes so here we get the left hand side just to summarize and here is the
33:43
coordinate we have covered what is called the energy density we have also seen what is energy flux we
33:50
have also covered momentum density and we have covered the fourth quadrant that is shear
33:56
stress tensor which actually comprises of pressure and shear stress all these four coordinates actually
34:03
contributes in making up stress energy momentum tensor which eventually causes the curvature of
34:08
space-time so this is a quick time to take a break and i think
Take a break
34:14
that you can i will just quickly go and grab my cup of coffee and you can also take a break once which
34:21
uh start with the concluding next part of the video well you i can tell you this much
34:26
that for a topologist there is no difference between this dancing cup of coffee and the hot and
34:32
uh you know yummy doughnut which is waiting on your plate so time to take a break
34:42
so we come to the concluding part of our uh discussion which is called the richie curvature tensor
Ricci curvature tensor
34:48
now before we start with the richie curvature tensor although this is not the right uh i would say not the right
34:55
video but however i would like to tell you how the richie curvature tensor the hierarchy it happens
35:01
first we need to understand and we will do it in another video about what is called a riemann curvature
35:07
tensor i call him to be a granddaddy because from the riemann curvature tensor we go
35:12
to ritchie curvature tensor we should note that richie tensor is actually also a symmetric tensor
35:18
which further leads to ritchie scalar and this reachy scalar is basically contraction of the ritchie
35:25
tensor we will see a part in this video so richie scalar is basically a contraction of the ritchie tensor
35:31
and the ritchie tensor eventually is a contraction of the riemann curvature tensor so you don't worry about this equation
35:38
which i have written this is basically again we are working on the covariant derivative so from the riemanns
35:45
we get the richie curve tensor from the richie curvature tensor we get to the richie scalar and if even
35:51
if we go back as i have shown in the arrow richie scalar is a contraction of ritchie curvature which is a contraction of the
35:57
riemann curvature tensor so this is just to know how we arrived at richie curvature or richie scalar
36:03
it is only through riemann that it is possible so uh richie curvature actually tracks a
36:11
volume change along geodesics which means that how volume grows and shrink in geodesics so
36:16
depending on the curvature that is the manifold that we are dealing richie curvature r shows the change in
36:22
volume and it happens either in a static way a growing way or it is decreasing so now
36:29
it is the right time that when we when we when we see this sentence that richie curvature
36:35
tracks volume change along geodesics what do we actually mean so for that let
Change of volume under linear transformation
36:40
us go back quickly to our basic linear algebra and understand what is the change of volume under linear transformation
36:47
in orthogonal and non-orthogonal plane well this is important because when we when we tell what is a volume change we
36:54
need to understand the basic concept underlying what is a volume change now we have gone to our
37:01
school days where we have calculated the determinant that i have done it for a simple parallelogram so if we
37:07
consider these two vectors w and v occurring on uh this parallelogram which is on r2 that is two dimension
37:15
then the area of a parallel parallelogram can be calculated using this v and w vector using a
37:21
determinant right so we denote it by d t very simple i am not going further to explain
37:26
we all have calculated these on our school days now what do we mean by volume growth so
37:32
uh say for example i take a linear transformation rn mapping on m dimensional space
37:39
and i take an example of a one dimensional linear transformation so here what happens t maps the interval 0 1 which is on the
37:46
left hand side you can see on the x plane to the interval 0 3 on the x prime plane
37:52
and this actually shows something it becomes like this so the determinant of the matrix 3 actually it
37:59
shows that it stretches the object and their length is increased by a factor of 3.
38:04
now this this is a simple one-dimensional linear transformation now if i take something like this a 2d
38:10
linear transformation and i'm taking a b c d followed by x and y these are the two
38:16
components then it shows something like this so you see i uh on the left hand side
38:23
this is a this is just a you know kind of a box which gets transformed here
38:28
we get the uh x-axis minus two which is plotted over there and we get the y-axis also which
38:35
is in blue plotted over here now here what happens is the the object actually rotates by pi
38:41
radians now because this object is rotating and stretching it is increasing the area
38:46
by a factor of four so this is a kind of a typical example of stretching two dimensional linear transformation
38:56
if i take a three dimensional two dimensional linear transformation where i am stretching and flipping
39:02
the parallelogram of the the square it becomes something like this so you can see that the t doubles the
39:09
area right and the orientation is also reversed orientation means if you move counterclockwise uh just
39:16
taken you can do this on the screen if you move counterclockwise it leads in the opposite color
39:22
so you see from the blue the blue is here and the yellow is over here so here the
39:28
basic essence to give you is that the area is doubled and the orientation is
39:33
also reversed now let us take a example of a three-dimensional linear transformation
39:40
so we take the two-dimensional linear transformation something like this where i'm taking three axis xyz and i'm
39:47
computing it as ax and we take the matrix from a11 to a33
39:52
now i've got a cube uh something like this which is plotted on the xyz axis here it is so you see that the cube
40:01
has transferred into a parallelopiped and the stretching if you calculate the determinant which we did earlier
40:08
stretches the volume to 12. so the expansion of the volume of t
40:13
is reflected by the fact that determinant of a becomes 12 and the t the the the t
40:21
actually rotates the cube and stretch it to a parallel pipette of volume 12. so this is and but but most most
40:28
importantly the same four colors are in the same order when it is moving counterclockwise
40:34
right so this is a typical example where a cube is getting linearly transformed into a
40:41
parallelopipet the determinant of the cube when calculated expands to 12. so that means it has
40:48
stretched and the volume has also increased
40:53
let us go for a quick summary on linear transformation so transformations uh determinant specifies
40:59
how the volume changes so if we get classically volume determinant is 1 the volume is preserved
41:05
if it is negative there is a mirroring and the face is reversed when if it is doing an orthogonal transforms
41:12
then the shape is actually preserved so what happens right on the screen you see the cube is being stretched to a cuboid where the
41:19
length i have marked it in red increases the sphere gets extended to a oblate
41:25
spheroid so you can see the blue mark which is on the sphere gets extended
41:30
much bigger in the oblique ferrite so if i take these two things the parallelopiped and sorry the yes the
41:37
cube transferring to parallelopiped sphere sphere going to a blitz ferrite the volume if i considered it to be zero
41:44
when it is uh transformed it becomes v 0 multiplied by the magnitude of x
41:50
multiplied by the magnitude of y multiplied by the magnitude of z so this is actually a way in which we
41:57
show that the volume is increasing
42:03
so uh now we have to understand that these are all happening on orthonormal basis so everything is in
42:10
orthonormal basis but we need to understand one thing that general theory deals with
42:15
non-orthonormal bases but or rather it deals with an arbitrary system so whatever the
42:21
linear transformation that i have been showing are basically on an orthonormal basis so the question is that can we take the
42:28
same transformation equation or using the same method can we do it in a non-orthonormal basis
42:36
obviously no and here we have to introduce a concept which is called volume form or volume element which is denoted
42:42
by the term omega now the volume form the definition goes it is a special differential form
42:49
defined on a oriented riemannian manifold which introduces a natural concept of
42:54
measure on the manifold and it is a tensor so just to take into account let us you know simplify terms it volume
43:03
form or volume element is going to calculate volume but not on an orthonormal basis which is
43:08
in a non-orthonormal basis and which takes care of different curvatures etc and it is a
43:14
natural concept of measures so it is measurement only but on a different manifold
What is volume form / element ?
43:23
so let us see what is the volume form let us go on a very simple definition so if i
43:28
take a cuboid we calculate the volume which is length multiplied by breadth multiplied by
43:33
height but if we take a volume integral say for example if we take the same cuboid
43:38
then the volume integral is the basically a triple integral which i have taken over the different differential of x y
43:47
and z and the volume element which we considered is the differential element of dv that is the differential of v
43:54
whose volume integral over some surface which i have mentioned just as d g in a given coordinate system is given
44:00
by this so v equals to the triple integral of the differential of the axis x y and z so here i have
44:08
shown in the blue arrow that from volume element which is the differential of the x
44:13
y and z components taken over a triple integral goes to a volume integral which is
44:19
basically the differential and it leads to volume so from volume we go to volume element
44:24
integral and from volume integral we calculate the volume element
44:29
now in the volume element for example if you are taking a cube which is in an euclidean space v means
44:36
it is an integration of a function with respect to volume in various coordinates so differential of the volume equals to
44:43
what the differential of x y and z quite clear if we take a spherical coordinate system which is there on the
44:49
left hand side of your screen obviously in spherical coordinate system we have to include the sine theta
44:54
and the differential element of phi so the volume element is this which is r squared times the sine theta
45:02
of d theta d phi of d r and if you're considering the polar coordinate system
45:07
we get this one which is the differential volume so the basic essence is to make you
45:13
understand that basically volume element and volume form is is the understanding of the volume but
45:19
in a different way because we are moving from the orthonormal to the non-orthonormal basis
45:26
so i will just show you in a quick simple example what is the volume form so for example
45:31
if we take this particular parallelogram in a two dimension a and b are the two acting vectors so we get the
45:38
volume v equals to omega of the two acting vectors a and b if i take a similar kind of a cube where
45:44
there are three uh three vectors a b and c then the volume
45:49
is given by omega of a b and c now uh if you have seen my earlier videos that the tensor
45:55
is being taken by uh i would say from old bases to new bases i've always
46:01
mentioned it by e1 tilde or e2 tilde here you see that the parallelogram is
46:06
non-orthonormal it is not in 90 degrees it is tilted and so are the basis vector so what do
46:12
we do just from the uh you forget the right hand part the cube part let us take the parallelogram which is
46:18
in two dimension concentrate on the on the on the parallelogram on the two dimension
46:24
here what we do is that we calculate the determinant by taking a square root okay i'm not
46:30
going into why it is done because then we have to show the entire equation this is the determinant followed by a
46:36
square root followed by the determinant of g this g if you can recall is basically the
46:42
metric tensor i hope now you can understand the link because metric tensor actually
46:47
denotes any measurement on the riemann manifold which is the key for general relativity
46:53
so when we are calculating the determinant of this particular matrix then we have to take the square
47:00
root of the determinant of the metric tensor followed by the determinant of this normal uh vectors which is b1
47:07
b2 and a1 e2 now you see that this determinant of g actually takes care of the
47:14
transformation from orthonormal to non-orthonormal basis so if we are
47:20
transferring a volume which i have shown earlier that from the euclidean place we cannot do the same linear
47:26
transformation and measure a volume so we have to take care of the volume form
47:31
which is the differential volume but the differential volume has to take care of a metric tensor
47:37
because we are taking arbitrary bases right so from here from non orthonormal to orthonormal this is taken care by the
47:43
determinant square root of the determinant of metric tensor followed by this epsilon sign don't worry this is
47:49
called the levitivator symbol uh i will make another video on leviticus symbol it is just a
47:55
simple way of writing the indices of the tensor because node we are using two dimension
48:00
i have mentioned epsilon i and j so for the two vectors we get two components i and j followed
48:06
by the ith element of d vector and the jth element of a vector and this
48:12
arrow in blue shows that it gives the volume form or volume element of the two dimension
48:18
and it takes care of the square root of the metric tensor so this one is the volume form on non
48:24
non-orthonormal basis and this is the volume form on orthonormal basis
48:30
so uh so we can write it more cleanly so this is the volume from a
48:35
non-orthonormal which is volume equals to the omega of abc and v denotes volume
48:41
this is the volume form of non-orthonormal basis where v equals to omega abc followed by the
48:47
determinant of metric tensor g y because it takes arbitrary uh points followed by the
48:53
levici vita symbol epsilon now you see i have written i j k why i
48:59
have written i j k because we are comparing this now with a cube which is a three dimensional object and
49:05
we have to write i j k so the ith term of c the jth term of a followed by the kth
49:12
term of b so now to avoid further derivations i have kept a simple
49:17
form which is the minus r and this is actually the richie tensor so you now
49:23
can relate that from the non-orthonormal we move to orthonormal basis from two dimension i showed you a
49:29
two-dimensional orthonormal calculation then we come to the three-dimensional orthonormal calculation
49:34
from this three-dimensional orthonormal i am showing you that this v actually relates to the ritchie tensor
49:40
so the change of volume which is determined by the root over of determinant of metric tensor
49:46
now comes here in the ritchie tensor this minus term uh is basically a indication which shows
49:54
that the uh the curvature is positive what is curvature is what means uh by positive curvature we
50:01
will just show in a few moments so you can see this purple line this v and this v are the same right so that
50:08
actually proves that the volume change from the non-orthonormal basis to richie tensor
50:14
is actually the change of volume along the geodesics so for example we get this kind of a
Geodesics along the sphere
50:20
sphere which is uh it is a fear sphere and here are you know i have just drawn
50:27
a few people walking around the sphere the orange and the green one so if they are moving along the geodesic in this
50:33
purple line eventually they meet at the north pole all right similarly on the right hand side you see
50:40
a sphere and i have marked it in red and these are converging geodesics these are actually meeting at a point
50:46
and here is a ball i move the ball further and further and further and further
50:53
so what actually happens the ball actually shrinks in size now i think you can visualize and
50:59
understand what is actually called shrinking in size which is taken care from the
51:04
richie curvature tensor now this part of shrinking in size is actually taken care
51:10
by the ritchie tensor so you see on the bottom of the screen i have written the r in red because you need to
51:17
understand that gravity in general theory of relativity is nothing an external force which we considered in
51:25
newtonian mechanics gravity is basically a natural tendency of of the curvature of geodesics so
51:33
i have written the right hand side the ball shrinks in size as it moves along the geodesic meaning
51:38
the curvature is positive so if you remember previously i have shown that this minus r
51:44
don't worry that was basically derivation when einstein put it that was the negative sign is not here so this
51:51
r actually denotes that the curvature is positive and positive curvature is actually means
51:57
that things or the matter will converge and it shrinks in size so
52:02
r in general theory of reliability is the curvature tensor and it is basically a measurement of gravity which
52:09
is a natural tendency of the curvature of space-time not anything external as a force
52:16
this is a change in volume if i move this box uh yes so it goes from here to here you
52:23
see there is no change in volume so the straight geodesic so i have just
52:28
taken three dimensions v1 v2 v3 the richie curvature becomes zero in this kind of a converge
52:34
geodesics if i move the cube one two three four and five you'd see it reduces
52:42
right in volume so because richie curvature is greater than zero that means it has got a positive curvature
52:48
positive curvature means that the volume is shrinking if i take a this kind of a geodesic at
52:54
the last one on the left hand side of your screen this is actually diverging geodesic so
52:59
what happens it goes here and then here and then here so eventually what is happening it is
53:06
increasing in size so you can just take a quick capture of this screen so we have got
53:11
three types of curvatures where the volume is not changing a flat one the straight geodesic where the volume
53:18
is not changing equals to zero the converging geodesics where the uh that the curvature is
53:24
greater than zero it is converging and the increase in volume which is diverging geodesics
53:29
where the richie curvature is less than zero so the richie scalar
Ricci scalar
53:36
as you see over here which i have pointed out now we will come to the point of richie scalar
53:41
so you see the richie scalar actually keeps track of how the size of a ball deviates
53:46
from standard euclidean space now no don't get confused between richie scalar and richie curvature
53:52
reachy curvature is actually a measurement how a ball or an object shrinks in size or
53:59
it grows in size or it remains static based on the curvature of space-time but
54:04
richie scalar actually shows how a ball deviates the change in the ball we will i will show
54:10
you in the another video how we come and we numerically we measure richie scalar
54:16
when we parallel transport things so here the ball deviates from the euclidean space so this is a flat circle
54:24
in a two dimension in in in three dimension done not then it gets to a disk and when we
54:30
try to pose this disk on the sphere i i mean to say i am immersing this disk
54:35
on a sphere it actually takes more area so this is what richie scalar does so the uh
54:42
keeping track of the volume in euclidean space and how it deviates
54:47
in a non-euclidean space so here this red arrow shows that if i'm trying
54:52
to fit this disc on the sphere it is actually taking more area
54:59
so i will continue with richie scalar with few more examples here is the area of the circle which is pi
55:05
r squared now this black area which i have shown i'm trying to fit that circle over here
55:11
so what it is happening the area is increasing the surface area further gets increased
55:17
as the as the sphere gets smaller and finally you see that it further
55:22
increases and here the area equals to 2 pi r squared right so this is basically a sense when we are trying
55:29
to uh i would say when we're trying to immerse a circle and we want to see
55:36
that how this circle is deviating from the euclidean space to the non-euclidean
55:42
space when we are putting it on the sphere this is actually what richie scalar does so here is a
55:48
quick note that as a circle becomes shorter circle becomes shorter means the curvature is more positive
55:54
we can fit more area hence we can say that we can fit large amount of area in a small boundary
Geodesic deviations
56:02
so here are the geodesic deviations uh simple this is a flat one uh where richie is

zero r there is no increase in volume this is uh is a convergent geodesic which has shown
56:15
on a sphere where the richie curvature is greater than zero and the volume decreases and the last one which i have taken a
56:22
saddle uh well there are other i would say other uh visualizations of a negative
56:29
curvature but it is good to go with a saddle so here you see that the geodesics
56:34
are diverging and r is less than zero so the volumes increases so three simple example of geodesic
56:42
geodesic deviations and how r is actually measuring no volume increase
56:47
volume decreases and the volume increase
56:53
so here is a flat circle r equals to zero and when i'm imposing or trying to fit
56:59
it over a sphere the area is more and again taking the same r equals to zero when i'm trying to
57:05
fit on a saddle or where there's a uh you know kind of negative curvature the it occupies a lesser area
57:18
so here we come to this equation so you see on the left hand side r sub a b is equivalent okay let me let
57:25
me explain you one by one so this is the reachy tensor we are quite clear on this this one is the riemann curvature tensor
57:32
okay this one you have already recognized g is the metric tensor and this one is the riemann curvature
57:38
tensor most important part in this equation you see that this one the c
57:44
and d which is the first and the third indices are being contracted in the riemann cur
57:50
in the richie in the riemann tensor so i have written the ritchie curvature tensor is a contraction of the first and
57:56
the third index of riemann tensor i think i've shown it earlier also so in the in the in the richie curvature tensor
58:04
you see the c part that is the red one on your right hand side is not there
58:09
and the third one two three the d part is omitted so we contract the first and third index
58:14
of riemann curvature tensor and we put it in the ritchie tensor
Summary
58:23
so now we come up to the end part of the video it is nice time that we should summarize what we have learned
58:28
so we have learned what is mu new and it actually is a measurement of four dimensions of space and time we
58:35
have also learned how we can reduce the 16 partial differential equation to 10 by reducing the redundant components of
58:43
the metric tensor and the stress energy tensor we have always seen that einstein tensor
58:51
and its zero divergence property and we have also seen that why einstein senses zero
58:56
divergent property equals to the stress energy tensor zero divergent property and both the sides balance we have also
59:03
taken a quick note on stress energy momentum tensor however i've got some more ideas in putting up
59:10
and making a separate video on stress energy momentum tensor we have also seen change of volume under
59:17
linear transformation and how it leads to volume element and differential volume we have seen what is a reachy curvature
59:23
tensor and what it leads to the change of volume under geodesics and finally we have seen what is a
59:29
richie scalar which is the you know how a circle changes
59:35
or the amount of deviation from euclidean to non-euclidean space so thank you for watching the video i
59:42
think that it has been little bit long but it was required because lot of integrated concepts were required into
59:48
this do subscribe and like and comment and i would really like i would appreciate if you
59:54
are putting up comments in my channel one thing which is left i understand which is not
1:00:00
complete is the metric tensor so i am coming up with another video where i am explaining the mathematical
1:00:06
and the intuitive understanding of metric tensor so once this metric tensor is done we are left with the cosmological constant
1:00:13
the poisons gravitational equation and then we will merge them together into the final i
1:00:19
would say the integration part of einstein's field equations so do the subscribe do like comment and
1:00:25
let me know how you have liked the video any part which is confusing please do put up in the comment box and i would
1:00:31
like to explain further thank you very much stay safe and stay happy and have a nice day
