JAKE XIA: This is the second time we are having this class. We had it last year in a smaller version.
0:27
That was for six units of a credit, and we had it once a week. And mostly practitioners from the industry,
0:36
from Morgan Stanley, talking about examples how math is applied in modern finance.
0:41
0:48
And so we got some good response last year. So, with the support of the math department,
0:53
we decided to expand this class to be 12 units of credit
0:58
and have twice a week. So, we have every Tuesday and Thursday afternoon from 2:30 to 4:00, as you know, in this classroom.
1:05
So last year, Dr. Vasily Strela and I-- by the way,
1:13
I'm Jake Xia and that's Dr. Vasily, and we were the main instructors last year.
1:18
Now we doubled it up to four main instructors. That's Dr. Peter Kempthorne and Dr. Choongbum Lee.
1:26
The reason we doubled up the main instructors is we have newly added math lectures, mostly focusing
1:35
from linear algebra, probability to statistics, and some stochastic calculus to give you the foundation
1:42
to understand the math will be used in those examples in the lecture taught by the practitioners
1:52
from the industry. And the purpose of this course is really to give you a sampling menu to see how mathematics is applied
2:02
in modern finance and help you to decide if this is a field that you would be-- RECORDED VOICE: Thank you, for using WebEx.
2:08
Please visit our website at www.webex.com.
2:14
JAKE XIA: OK, you heard that. And so hopefully, this will give you enough information
2:21
to decide this is a field you would like to pursue in your future career. In fact, last year when we finished the class,
2:29
we had a few students coming to work in the industry. Some work at Morgan Stanley, some work at elsewhere.
2:35
So that's really the goal. And at the same time, obviously, you
2:43
will further solidify your math knowledge and learn new content.
2:51
And we put the prerequisite about the math part a bit later.
2:56
So I will use today's first lecture's time to give you an introduction, really,
3:02
to prepare you some basic background knowledge about the financial markets.
3:08
Some terminologies will be used, which you may not have heard before.
3:13
So before I get into the introduction, I always like to know who are actually in the classroom,
3:19
so let me ask you a few questions. You just need to raise your hands so I know roughly what kind of background and where you are.
3:28
So how many undergraduate students are here?
3:33
So I would say 80% percent.
3:38
How many graduate students are here, just to verify? Yep, that's about right, 20%.
3:44
And how many students are in finance and business major?
3:51
Just one. And how many of you are a math major?
3:56
Most of you. How many of you are engineering majors?
4:02
A few. How many of you actually are from other universities?
4:08
Great, because last year we had quite a few, so I want to specifically tell you that you're very welcome to attend the classes here.
4:17
So it's open door. And last year I remember we had a couple of students
4:22
from Harvard. That's where I actually work right now.
4:29
I forgot to mention that, but I'm affiliated with both the math department and the Sloan school
4:35
here. So anyway, thanks for that. We will be doing a bit more polling along the way,
4:41
mainly to get feedback of how you feel about the class. Last year we had it online, so if you
4:48
feel the class is going too fast, or the math part is going too slow, or the finance part is a bit confusing,
4:55
the easiest way is really just to send us emails, which you will find from the class website.
5:02
So anyway, today-- VASILY STRELA: And all of us got MIT emails. JAKE XIA: Yes. We all have MIT emails, which are listed on the website.
5:10
VASILY STRELA: [INAUDIBLE]. JAKE XIA: And obviously, we have offices here.
5:17
You can easily stop by Peter and Choongbum's offices. And Vasily and I probably will be less often on campus,
5:26
but we'll be here quite often and definitely love to be more. So anyway, I will start today's lecture with a story,
5:35
and a quiz at the end. Don't worry, it's not a real quiz. Just going to ask you some questions
5:40
you can raise your hand and give your answer. But let me start with my story.
5:46
This is actually my personal story. I want to tell you why I tell the story later.
5:52
But the story actually was in the mid '90s. I just left Salomon Brothers -- that was my first financial
6:01
industry job -- to go to Morgan Stanley in New York to join
6:06
the options trading desk. So the first day, I sat down, I opened the trading book,
6:15
I found something was missing. So, I turned around, I asked my desk quant.
6:22
I said, where is the vega report? So, let me show you.
6:27
So that's the story.
6:33
So I'm obviously not going to tell you the story of Pi
6:39
or "Life of Pi." That's not a financial story. The rest of the story, alpha, beta, delta, gamma,
6:45
theta, which you will learn from Peter and Choongbum and Vasily's classes.
6:50
So I'm going to talk about vega. So by the way, before I tell you the story, what's unique about vega on this list?
6:57
AUDIENCE: It's not a Greek letter. JAKE XIA: It's not a Greek letter. That's right. So I turned around and asked my desk quant, I said,
7:04
where's the vega report? But how many of you actually know what a vega is?
7:09
OK, lot of people know. So anyway, I'm not going to-- just for the people who haven't heard about it before, it's
7:16
a measurement about a book or portfolio or position's sensitivity to volatility.
7:22
So, what is volatility? Which again, you will learn more in rigorous terms
7:29
how it's defined in mathematics. But the meaning of it is really a measurement or indication
7:36
of how volatile, or what's the standard deviation of a price can change over time.
7:43
That's all you need to know right now. I'm not going to ask you questions later. So my desk quant look at me, said--
7:52
this is supposed to be options trading desk, so he look at me puzzled.
7:58
So instead of answering my question, he handed over me a training manual for new employees and new analysts.
8:06
So I opened the training manual and looked it through. I actually found my answer.
8:12
So actually, at Morgan Stanley this is not called vega, it's called kappa.
8:17
So now, I remember to call it kappa. Kappa is actually a Greek letter. So further, I look on the same page
8:25
there was actually a footnote, which I copied down. So the footnote about why it's called kappa at Morgan Stanley.
8:39
Kappa is also called vega by some uneducated traders at the Salomon Brothers.
8:45
That's where I came from. I just joined. They have mistaken vega as a Greek letter
8:50
after gambling at Vegas. So anyway, so that was my first day.
8:58
So obviously, I learned how to call kappa very quickly, because I came from Salomon Brothers.
9:05
And I called it kappa in the last 17 years, but you will hear people calling it vega.
9:12
Obviously, I have probably more people calling it the vega. But anyway, so that's my first day at Morgan Stanley.
9:19
But why did I tell you the story? What point I try to make?
9:24
So this story is actually-- when you think about it, mathematical or quantitative finance is a rather new field.
9:33
A lot of these terms were newly introduced. And the pricing model of options, as you know,
9:42
was introduced in the Black-Scholes in the '70s, or some of the ground work may be done a bit earlier.
9:49
But it's not like finance was a quantitative profession
9:55
to start with. So what we witness in the last 30 years was really a transformation of the trading profession coming
10:04
from mostly under-educated traders. Some of them typically joined the firms in the mail room
10:13
and became trader later on. That's typical career path. And to nowadays, if you walk on the trading floor,
10:20
you talk to the traders, most of them have advanced degrees and quite a few of them have very high training
10:29
in mathematics and computer science. So what has changed over the last 20 or 30 years?
10:36
I myself, personally, was probably one of the data point experiencing this change.
10:44
And I certainly didn't expect I would be doing this when I was at MIT, but I
10:51
did that in the last 20 years. So the point I'm trying to tell you
10:59
is, before you dive into any details of mathematics
11:04
or any concept in finance in this class, just bear in mind,
11:11
this is a field developed in the last mostly 30 years, or even
11:16
shorter. And what you really need to ask questions is-- it's not really is it right or wrong in mathematics,
11:26
is it right or wrong in physics? So, how the concepts are established
11:31
and defined and verified. Because this is a field-- the transformation
11:37
about the participants, products, models, methodology,
11:42
everything are changing very rapidly. Even nowadays, they're still changing. So with that, I will give you some background
11:51
on how the financial markets actually started,
11:57
and that's really the history part of this industry.
12:03
So, when we talk about markets, we know in early days people need to exchange goods.
12:10
You have something I don't have, I have something you don't have, so there's exchanges.
12:15
Then it becomes centralized. There are stock exchanges, futures exchanges all over the world where these products will
12:22
be listed as securities on these exchanges. That's one way of trading, which is centralized.
12:30
Obviously, in the last 10, 15 years, now we have ECNs, electronic platforms.
12:37
Trade over-- you know, even larger volume of those trades. So, financial products is really just one form of trading.
12:47
There are many other ways of trading aside from exchanges. One of them, which is called OTC,
12:55
is over-the-counter, meaning two counterparties agree to do a trade without really subject to the exchange rules,
13:05
or the underlying trading agreement does not have to be a securitized product, or standardized,
13:13
or whatever ways you define it. And the different regions have different exchanges
13:18
and markets, as well. And they typically specialize in local products, local company
13:25
stocks, local bonds, and local currencies.
13:31
So, there are many different forms. So again, what's in common?
13:37
That's the question you need to ask. Also, you don't know the specifics. And the currencies, money itself, are also traded.
13:47
And that's where different currencies issued by different countries.
13:52
So, when we talk about trading stocks-- there are also people trade baskets of stocks,
13:57
trade groups of stocks together, and that's stock index or indices.
14:03
So, there are different products. How the stock get listed on the stock exchange?
14:09
It goes through IPO-- Initial Public Offering process. So, when a company changes from private to public,
14:17
it goes through this IPO process. It's called primary market, primary listing.
14:23
And once the stock is listed on the exchange
14:28
and it becomes traded in the market, we call it secondary trading. So, that's after the primary market.
14:36
And equity or stock is one form of trading or one form of financial products.
14:43
What are other forms? Loans. Actually, debt products are more generic than equity products.
14:52
When you started thinking about it, what is really finance is about?
14:57
It's really about someone has money, someone doesn't. Someone has money to lend out, someone needs to borrow money.
15:05
So, that's loan. Loan is really a private agreement between two counterparties or multiple counterparties.
15:13
When you securitize them, they become bonds. And when you look at bonds, every government
15:20
will issue large sovereign debt. So, US government has large outstanding US Treasury debt--
15:27
bonds, notes, bills. And corporates have issued a lot of debt product, as well.
15:34
They borrow money when they need to build a new factory or expand. Universities borrow money.
15:41
When MIT needs to build a new building, some of the money will come from the endowment support,
15:47
some will come from some other form of research budget, or some will come from debt financing.
15:55
Just borrow from the public-- local governments, states, counties, even.
16:01
So, they have various forms. So, that's debt product. Commodities, actually, you know.
16:10
Metal, energy, agriculture products are traded, mostly in the futures
16:15
format and some in physical format, meaning you take deliveries. When you actually buying and sell,
16:21
you build a warehouse to take them. You ship a tank to store above the ocean.
16:29
And the real estate, you're buying and sell houses. 2008 financial crisis, if you read about it,
16:36
this has a lot to do with the real estate market, the mortgages, and asset-backed securities.
16:44
So, I'm not trying to give you all the definition, dumping the information on you. But I like you at least hearing it once today,
16:52
and then you have more interest, you can read on the side. So asset-backed securities is when you have an asset,
17:00
you basically issue a debt with the asset backing it.
17:06
And how do you rate the asset's risk level and what's the income stream, cash flow?
17:14
And before 2008 financial crisis, as you heard, large amount of CMBS-- basically,
17:25
it's a commercial real estate backed securities, mortgage securities, and the residential, as well.
17:33
And further of all of these, you heard probably a lot about the derivative products.
17:39
So, that started with swaps, options. And the structure of the products, it
17:44
become more tailor-made for either investors or borrowers
17:51
to structure the products in a way to suit their needs. And some of the complexity of those structured products
17:59
become quite high, and the mathematics involved in pricing them and the risk management
18:05
become rather challenging.
18:14
So coming back to the players in the market,
18:23
one large type of player is really bank.
18:29
Essentially, after 1933 Glass-Steagall legislation,
18:34
there were two main types of banks. One is called commercial bank, the other is investment bank.
18:40
Commercial bank is supposedly, you're taking deposits and lend out the money,
18:46
and doing more commercial services. Investment bank supposed to focus on the capital markets,
18:55
raising capital, trading, and asset management.
19:00
But obviously, after 1999, the Glass-Steagall was repealed.
19:08
There's no longer that. Some people blame that, and probably for a very good reason, for the cause of 2008 financial crisis.
19:18
But I want to tell you how currently investment banks are organized.
19:23
Vasily just mentioned he works in the fixed income.
19:31
So banks typically organized by institutional business and asset management.
19:37
So, within the institutional client business, it has typically three main parts.
19:43
Fixed income, which trade the debt and the derivative products.
19:48
Equity, trade stocks and the derivative products. And IBD, stands for Investment Banking Division,
19:57
which really covers corporate finance, raising capital, listing a stock, IPO, and merger
20:05
and acquisition, and advisory. So that's how banks are organized.
20:11
Outside banks, other players, basically, the asset managers, are obviously a very big force in the financial markets.
20:19
So the question a lot of people ask is, is this a zero sum game?
20:27
I'm sure you've heard this many times. So, in the financial markets, some people win,
20:32
some people lose. A lot of times, it depends on the specific products you
20:38
trade, the market you're in. It is, lot of times, pretty net zero.
20:44
But why do we need financial markets? This comes back to what I described before.
20:53
Because something existed-- actually, there's a need for it. It's really the need to bridge between the lenders
21:02
and the borrowers. That's really coming down to the essential relationship.
21:07
So, investors who have money need to have better yield or better return, better interest.
21:14
In the current environment, when you have a savings account, you don't really earn much at all.
21:21
And so you would have to take more risk to generate more
21:26
return, or you have longer horizon CDs, other type of products, or trade the stocks.
21:34
So, when somebody has money, when you trade stocks, you're essentially-- you're buying a stock,
21:41
you give the money somewhere. Supposedly, it will go to the company. Company use the money to generate a better return.
21:50
And for the borrowers, whoever needs money, they need to have access to the capital.
21:58
So obviously, different borrowers have different risks. Some people borrow money, never return.
22:04
So, never generate any returns, or never even return the principal. And so the trade between lenders and the borrowers,
22:12
is again, essentially the main driver of the financial markets.
22:20
So, a few more words about the market participants. So, banks and so-called dealers play the role of market making.
22:30
What is market making? So, when you or some end user go to the market,
22:36
wants to buy or sell, typically, if there's no market, you don't really find the match.
22:43
And some of the products you want to buy or sell may not necessarily be liquid.
22:48
So, the dealers step in the middle, make you a price. Say, OK, you want to buy or sell.
22:55
I can tell you-- this stock, I make you price.
23:00
$0.99, and that's my bid. $0.95, that's my offer.
23:08
So, that's the price I'm willing to buy or sell. But what the result of the trade-- the dealer
23:15
actually takes the other side of your trade. So, they take principal risk, in this case.
23:21
So, that's the difference between dealers and the brokers. So, brokers don't really take principal risks.
23:28
If you want to buy something or sell something, if I'm a broker, I don't make you a price.
23:34
I go to the market makers. I actually put two people together,
23:40
matchmaking, make that trade happen. So, I earn the commission. So, that's a broker's role.
23:47
So obviously, there are individual investors, retail investors, same meaning.
23:52
Mutual funds, who actually manage public investors' money,
23:57
typically in the long-only format. Long means you buy something.
24:04
So, you don't really short sell a particular security.
24:09
Insurance companies has large asset. They need to generate a return, generate cash flow to meet their liability needs.
24:17
So, they need to invest. And the pension funds, same thing. As inflation goes higher, they need
24:22
to pay out more to the retirees, so where do you get the return? Sovereign wealth fund, similarly, endowment
24:29
funds-- they all have this same situation, have capital and needs to deploy and to make better return.
24:36
So this other type of players, hedge funds. So, how many of you have heard hedge funds?
24:45
OK, good. Almost everyone. And Peter mentioned that he used to work at a hedge fund.
24:51
And so, there are different types of strategies, which I will dive into a bit more,
24:58
but hedge fund play the role in the market-- they basically find opportunities to profit from inefficient market
25:08
positioning or pricing, so they have different strategies. And the private equity is different type of funds.
25:16
They basically look to invest in companies
25:22
and either take them private or invest in a private equity form
25:29
to hopefully improve the company's profitability, and then catch up.
25:35
And governments obviously have a huge impact on the market. So, we know in the financial crisis, government intervened.
25:45
And not only that, at the normal market condition, government always have a very large impact on the market,
25:52
because they are the policymakers. They decide the interest rate and interest rate curve.
25:57
And the different policies they push out, obviously, will generate different outlook for the future markets,
26:05
therefore, profitability. Then the corporate hedges and the liabilities. When corporates borrow money, they create some risk,
26:13
so they need to be sensitive to the market, it changes.
26:20
So, to summarize the types of trading. The first type is really just hedging.
26:28
That means you're not proactively adding risk to what you have. You already have some exposure.
26:34
Just give you an example. Let's say you borrow money, you bought a house,
26:41
so you have mortgage. So, let's say it's a floating rate mortgage payments.
26:51
And you're worried about interest rates going higher, so you can lock that rate in into the fixed rate format.
26:59
Or you can find ways to hedge your exposure. Or your corporate has a large income coming from Europe.
27:09
So, you have euros coming in, but you're not sure if euro would trade stronger to the US dollar in the future,
27:17
or trade weaker. If you think it will be stronger, you just leave it. But if you think it will trade weaker,
27:25
so you may want to hedge it, meaning you want to sell euro and buy US dollars.
27:30
And so that's the hedging type. The second type, as I mentioned, is a market maker. So, market maker also takes principal risk,
27:38
but the main source of profit is really to earn the bid offer.
27:44
I gave you the example $0.90 bid, $0.95 offer. So, that's what the market maker is trying to profit from.
27:53
But obviously, they have residual risks sitting on the book. Not every trade is matched.
27:59
So, how to optimize those group of trades, that's what market maker is doing.
28:06
Most of the bank's dealers are market makers. In the new regulation, obviously, proprietary trading
28:14
is banned, right? And so the third type is really the proprietary trader,
28:21
the risk taker. So, these are the hedge funds or some portfolio managers.
28:27
They need to focus on generating return and control the risk.
28:33
So, that's where the beta and alpha, the concept comes in. So, if you're a portfolio manager, some people say,
28:41
don't worry. Don't go pick any stocks. Just buy S&P 500 index fund. Very cheap.
28:47
You can pay very little cost to do it. That's true. But if you want to beat the S&P 500
28:55
index-- let's assume we call S&P 500 index fund is asset b.
29:03
So, the return of that, R(b). That's a return of that index. Now, you have a portfolio a.
29:11
Your time series of return of your asset a, obviously, you can do linear regression.
29:18
A lot of you are math major here, and you can find a correlation between those two time series.
29:26
So, how the two returns are related in a simplified form. So you can say, this actually-- somehow it came out.
29:35
It's supposed to be alpha and beta, but it turned out to be the letters.
29:41
So, in a short description, beta is really-- just think as correlated move with the other asset.
29:50
Alpha is really the difference in the return.
29:56
It's a format. You want to beat S&P 500, so you want to basically have certain tracking of this index,
30:02
but you want to return more on top of that.
30:10
So let me just go in bit of details of how each type of trade actually occurs.
30:18
So, when we talk about hedging, I mentioned the currency example. Let me give you another example.
30:23
There are a lot of people issue bonds, or issue debt. So this example I'm going to give you is,
30:29
let's think about Australian corporate. Because interest rate in Australia
30:36
is higher than in Japan, so typically, people like to borrow money in Japan, because you
30:44
pay smaller interest. And they invest it in Australia. You earn higher interest rate.
30:54
So let me ask you a question. Who can tell me, why don't people just do that all day long, just borrow from Japan
31:02
and invest it in Australia? Then that interest rate, I'm giving you
31:08
example of a difference is about 3.5% for the roughly 10 year
31:15
swap rates. Yeah, go ahead. AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]. JAKE XIA: Right.
31:21
Because you invest in the Australia Ozzie, Australian dollar. The Australian dollar may become weaker to the yen.
31:27
You may lose all your profit, or even more. And further, if everybody plays the same game, then
31:35
when you try to exit, you have the adverse impact of your trade.
31:41
So, let's say you think that's the right time to do it, but then at one time, you wake up,
31:47
you said, huh, I think too many people are doing this. I want to hedge myself. So, what do you do? AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?
31:52
JAKE XIA: Yep. So, you try to lock in, right? So basically, you sell the Australian dollars,
32:00
buy the Japanese yen. Or on the interest rate terms, you say you'll basically pay the Australian dollar in the swap
32:09
leg, and receive yen. This involves foreign exchange trade, interest rate swap,
32:19
and the cross-currency swap. So, your answer about currency forward is roughly right,
32:26
but obviously involves a bit more in actual execution.
32:31
So that's just to give you example. Even if you are not a finance guy, you work in a corporate, you just do you import, export,
32:39
or building a factory, you have to know, actually, what the exposure is.
32:44
So, risk management, nowadays, becomes pretty widespread responsibility.
32:50
It's not just the corporate treasury's responsibility.
32:55
So, that's on the hedging side. Obviously, if you are Intel, for example,
33:01
you sell a lot of chips overseas. And your income-- actually, Intel does
33:07
have lot of overseas income sitting outside the States. So, the exposure to them is if the exchange rate fluctuates,
33:16
dollar becomes a lot stronger, they actually lose money. So, they need to think about how to hedge the revenue produced
33:24
overseas. And obviously, for import-exporters,
33:30
that's even more apparent. And if you're entering in a merger deal,
33:36
and one company is buying another, you need to hedge your potential currency
33:41
exposure and your interest rate exposure. And whatever is on the assets, or the liability,
33:48
or the balance sheet, you need to hedge your exposure.
33:56
So we talked about hedging activity. Let's talk about market making.
34:01
So if it's a simple transparent product, everybody pretty much knows where the price is.
34:07
So, if you buy Apple stock, I think a lot of people know pretty much where it is. You may even have it on your cellphone,
34:15
know where that stock is. But if it's not transparent, so what do you do?
34:21
So, if instead of asking you where Apple is, probably you're going to tell me $495 today. AUDIENCE: I don't really know.
34:27
JAKE XIA: OK. But if I asked you instead, what is the call option on Apple stock in two month's time?
34:37
I'll give you a strike, let's say, 500. So you're probably less transparent. So that market maker comes in to provide that liquidity,
34:46
and then takes the risk. They manage the book by balancing those Greeks, which
34:52
I mentioned earlier. Delta, which describes the [INAUDIBLE] relationship
34:59
of this whole book to the underlying stock, or underlying whatever currency. That's called delta.
35:05
Gamma is really the change of the portfolio.
35:11
Take the derivative to the delta, or to the underlying spot.
35:16
So, that's second-order derivative. Delta is the first order. So gamma, now you have curvature or convexity coming in.
35:27
And theta is really-- nothing changes in the market. Nothing changes in your position.
35:34
How your trading book is carrying or bleeding away
35:39
money. And we talk about the volatility exposure was vega. And on top of that, what are the tail risks?
35:47
What are the events can actually get you into big trouble? So people use value at risk.
35:54
So you will hear this "VaR" concept in some of the lectures, which is also, obviously,
35:59
a very important concept. I think Peter will-- or Choongbum will-- probably Peter will teach.
36:06
Then capital. How much capital are you using? It becomes a very important issue nowadays.
36:13
And balance sheet. Again, you have asset, you have liability. How do you leverage?
36:19
How much leverage you have? Before the crisis, for example, lot of the banks leverage up 40 times, meaning when you have $1, you had $40 exposure.
36:29
So when the market moves little, you get wiped out. That's really what amplified in the 2008 financial crisis.
36:36
And how do you measure the asset in balance sheet when you have derivatives rather than a straightforward
36:43
notional?
36:50
So lot of quantitative type of people like to focus a bit more on the risk taking side,
36:56
because people heard stories about successful cases of some hedge funds using high math.
37:03
They generated very impressive returns and they seem to have an edge.
37:09
So now, people focus on trading strategies. So that falls into the category of proprietary trading or risk
37:17
taking. So that you can just simply doing directional trading strategies. Just go long or short the stock.
37:24
That's very simple. Those so-called the gut traders, gut feeling.
37:29
Go with your gut. You don't even think. You say, I'm eating curry today, so I go long.
37:38
I'm eating rice tomorrow, so I go short. So, this arbitrage.
37:44
Arbitrage is really to find the relationships between prices,
37:50
and try to profit from those relationship mispricing.
37:56
This is actually very interesting. Not many people focus on arbitrage,
38:01
because lot of people are gut traders. You essentially just watch your own market. You don't really care what's going on.
38:07
If you trade gold in the States, the gold price
38:13
happen in Asia and in Europe matters, right, because you're trading the same thing.
38:18
If they are not priced the same way, you can profit from the difference. And that's just a simple example.
38:25
But a spot price versus forward price, that's a deterministic relationship.
38:31
It's a mathematical relationship. If that relationship breaks down, you can also profit. So there are many examples mathematical relationship
38:40
which gives you the arbitrage opportunity. The other type is called a value trader, or relative
38:47
value strategies. Think there's a deterministic, temporary mathematical
38:55
relationship. You look at the longer term in horizon, trying to determine what is really the underlying
39:01
value of a particular instrument, then trade on the relative value.
39:06
Obviously, there are successful value investors out there. And the systematic trader builds computer models.
39:15
One example is trend following, so just follow the price trend. That used to be an effective strategy for some time,
39:25
but when lot of people doing the same thing, that becomes much less effective.
39:31
Or momentum, same thing. Stat arb, finding statistical relationship
39:38
among large number of stocks, then trade at the higher frequency.
39:46
And fundamental analysis, you're really trying to understand what's going on in the world. What is the trade balance?
39:54
What is the earning potential of a company? What's the trade balance of a country?
40:00
What is a policy change? What does it mean when Federal Reserve announce they're going to taper the quantitative easing?
40:08
Why the stock market is sold off in the last couple months, especially why stocks in India, Brazil, Indonesia,
40:17
sold out more. Why is that? So it goes through those fundamental analysis.
40:22
And there are special situations. Some companies are going through particular difficulties,
40:31
assets are priced very cheaply. So, there are firms out there -- you probably heard Bain Capital
40:39
and many others -- where they focus on these private equity and special situation opportunities.
40:45
So what have all of these to do with mathematics?
40:55
Where does math come in? How do you use math? So, I want to give you some aspects of that.
41:02
So from my personal experience, I joined the market, really start to working on pricing models.
41:09
So, that's the first area. So, math is very effective, because when you, your bank, your corporate, you
41:19
want to buy some financial instruments, you have to know where is the price.
41:25
It's easy to observe a stock in the market, but when it comes to more complex products,
41:31
they just take one step forward on the complexity, which is the option.
41:36
You have to know how to price an option. So, that's where the math comes in. You actually have to be able to solve differential equations
41:43
to get a model price, then you obviously adjust to your assumptions to fit into the market.
41:51
So, pricing model, which Vasily and many of his colleagues
41:57
can tell you more-- which is very much a very interesting and challenging area.
42:03
How do you price all these instruments? And when I say pricing, it's not in the narrow definition
42:09
of just coming up with the price. When you build a pricing model, you also generate the risk parameters of these instruments,
42:18
and how do you risk manage them. So, that comes to the second part. So math is very useful in risk management,
42:26
which I will give you some -- not quiz -- questions after this slide.
42:31
You can see that risk management itself is very challenging. It's not a purely mathematical question,
42:37
but yet, math plays a very important role to quantify how much exposure you have.
42:44
Then, the third is trading strategies. Again, I think a lot of people with math background,
42:50
or in general, people are looking for the so-called holy grail trading strategies.
42:57
It's almost like perpetual motion machines people looking for 100 years ago. You just turn it on.
43:03
It makes money by itself. You go to sleep, you go on vacation, you come back, you'll have more in your bank account.
43:10
Obviously, that's not going to happen. The robotrader, a robotic trader, is a dream.
43:20
It has its place or its use, but it's a fast evolving market.
43:26
You have to constantly either upgrade your research
43:31
and adjust your strategies. There's no such thing you can build and leave it alone,
43:38
it runs for itself forever. But I just want to mention that because maybe
43:45
towards the end of the term you will feel, hmm, I came up with this brilliant trading strategy.
43:50
I think it's going to make money forever. Please let me know first.
43:55
AUDIENCE: And me second. PROFESSOR: So, I want to leave some time to Vasily.
44:04
Actually, he can give you some examples of projects of last year's students
44:10
who actually came to this class and did some real application
44:16
at Morgan Stanley. But before I hand it over to Vasily, let me ask you some questions.
44:22
I just want to-- not really to quiz you, just give you the sense how math and intuition and judgment
44:30
can come into the same place. So, let me first give you an example I call risk aversion.
44:35
So, you are facing two choices, choice A and a choice B. Choice
44:41
A being you have 80 chance to lose $500. You have 20% chance to win $500.
44:50
That's pretty clear, right? That's choice A. Or choice B, you basically
44:56
just lock in you have 100% chance to lose $280.
45:01
Let me ask you, for whoever likes to choose choice A,
45:08
please raise your hand.
45:15
One, two, three, four. About six out of say, let's call it 50.
45:22
So, can I ask you why you think choice A makes sense? AUDIENCE: So, I know it's a lower expected value,
45:27
but I enjoy gambling and I would rather take the chance of--
45:35
JAKE XIA: Right, because you don't want to lock in that $280 loss, right? That, or you still have 20% chance to win.
45:41
For the ones raised their hand for choice A, are there any other reasons?
45:48
Same reason. AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
45:56
JAKE XIA: I assume the rest of you would choose choice B, unless you-- Neither? How many of you choose choice B?
46:02
Choice B. And are there anybody think neither is right?
46:10
You have to choose. No, you have to choose.
46:16
So, either choice A or choice B. So, let me just talk a little bit about this.
46:22
Again, I'm not trying to tell you which one is right, but I just share my thoughts how we look at these.
46:27
Why it called risk aversion? So, this is very common human behavior.
46:33
When you go to the market, you buy a stock. When the stock goes up, makes bit of money,
46:40
the natural tendency -- for especially someone is new to the market -- is to let's take profit.
46:47
Let's sell. Oh, I made $1000. I made $500. Let's go have a nice meal or whatever.
46:54
Buy an iPad. But when the stock loses money, what's the natural tendency?
47:02
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] JAKE XIA: That's-- AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] JAKE XIA: I think natural tendency, lot of people
47:08
will keep it. I think if you have the discipline to get out, that's great.
47:14
Trading is really all about how do you risk manage, have the discipline, and how to manage your losses.
47:22
The natural tendency of a lot of people is, well, I think there's a 20% chance to come back, and I'm going to make $500 more.
47:29
Why do I want to lock in to stop myself out at 280? So even though the expected value-- I think lot of people
47:38
said, you lose expected value, which is $300 in choice A,
47:44
but you would still not to choose choice B,
47:49
because you don't want to lock in the $280 loss. Again, I'm not trying to inject the idea to you of which one
47:57
is right or wrong, but think about it. So, that's really the common behavior, which mathematically
48:05
may not make sense, but lot of people still would like to do. And also, really, when you think about it,
48:14
depends on your situation. And let's say, you think the market--
48:23
I'm giving you the stock example again. If you're not purely following the discipline of stop loss,
48:29
but you just think the fundamental picture has changed. You really don't think the stock should go up anymore.
48:36
Obviously, at whatever level you should get out, regardless how much loss you lock in.
48:41
But if you think the fundamental story is still very sound,
48:47
you should think about as if you don't have a position, what you want to do next.
48:52
But anyway, mathematically, I just want to see-- I guess this is MIT,
48:59
so many people think mathematically where you would actually choose choice B, because that's
49:07
low expectation, which makes sense. But I think if you ask a larger audience,
49:12
I think a lot of people don't really want to choose choice B, because they don't want to lock in the loss.
49:17
Now, let me change the question a little bit.
49:24
So, choice A becomes instead of the 80% chance to lose, now you have 80% chance to win $500 and 20% chance
49:34
to lose $500. Choice B, you have 100% chance to win $280.
49:43
Who would choose choice A? Again, minority of this audience.
49:50
Let's say less than 10%. Who would choose choice B? The rest of you.
49:56
All right. Can someone choose choice A give me an argument why would you?
50:04
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
50:15
JAKE XIA: Yep. Anyone want to give me a reason for choice B? AUDIENCE: Higher Sharpe.
50:20
JAKE XIA: Higher Sharpe? Mm-hm. Yup. Well, let me just leave it here.
50:28
Again, I think we can talk a bit more along in the class. I mean, the last day of the class,
50:34
hopefully we'll have much deeper discussion on this. It's not unique.
50:39
The answer, I think it can go you either way, as you said. If your bank account balance is-- let's
50:47
say you are a freshman student. Your bank account is $800.
50:54
Your choice will be very different from someone has $100,000 in his bank account.
51:01
And also, your risk tolerance, how much you can tolerate.
51:11
I'm not going to give you say, this is right or wrong. But with that, let me move on and give you some homework.
51:17
51:23
So, before I give you the homework, I want to make a few more comments. Do people always learn from their experiences?
51:30
In science, we collect evidence, we build models. We first understand the physics.
51:36
We build mathematical models, then we verify in physics, doing experiments.
51:41
But is that the same investigation process in finance?
51:48
Market cycles are typically very long, but people tend to have short memories.
51:53
So, how do people really learn from their experiences? A very interesting question. And very natural tendency is to extrapolate
52:01
historical experience. What happened in 2008? People still remember. What happened in 1970s?
52:09
Maybe some people still remember. What happened 100 years ago? So, people tend to extrapolate, drawing conclusions
52:17
from very recent experience. And deterministic relationship versus statistical relationship
52:24
is very interesting, as well. When you try to trade on those, how do you really build models?
52:31
Is the market really efficient? What part is efficient?
52:37
How do you really apply those theories in your day-to-day risk management or trading
52:43
activities? And sometimes, people tend to oversimplify.
52:49
Just say, oh, I can model this. This is one important parameter. I just take that.
52:55
So I just give you all the warnings that the-- again, very young, new field
53:02
and largely, often, this is art, than science.
53:07
So keep that in mind, even though we're talking about mathematics in finance. Math is very powerful and useful in finance.
53:15
So learn the math, learn the finance first, but keep those questions along the way
53:21
when you are learning during this class.
53:27
So suggested homework, optional.
53:32
I mentioned a lot of terminologies today. Go to the course website, read what we have put up
53:39
for the financial glossary. So if you still have things you don't understand,
53:45
compile your own list of financial concepts, which you can search on the web or even ask us.
53:53
But I encourage you to do that. It will prepare you well. So, that's really-- and read other materials
53:59
on the course work. So we got maybe-- how about this? We still got about 15 minutes or 12 minutes left,
54:08
so I'll pass it to Vasily, then maybe we can leave five minutes for some questions. VASILY STRELA: Yeah.
54:13
JAKE XIA: Yeah, OK. VASILY STRELA: [INAUDIBLE] mentioned that, Apple trades, that now it's $494.4 Yeah, just a couple
54:30
of [INAUDIBLE]. Well, first of all, no offense to people who were [INAUDIBLE],
54:42
but I just wanted to give an example of [INAUDIBLE].
54:47
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].
55:01
VASILY STRELA: --because he was working in our group, and it just will give you a little bit of an idea what
55:11
we will be talking about and what actually we do in the daily life, or what an intern or somebody who
55:18
comes to work in this industry could do. And one project is [INAUDIBLE] worked
55:26
was on estimating the noisy derivative. Derivative is called delta.
55:33
Delta is usually the first derivative to a function. And as we will see in the class, quite often, to obtain a price,
55:42
you do it through Monte Carlo, meaning running a lot of paths and then averaging along them.
55:48
So, it's a statistical method. So obviously, there is a noise to your answer every time.
55:56
So, if you want to differentiate this functions
56:01
and get a derivative, then this derivative will be quite noisy.
56:06
And so, instead of getting the true derivative, you might obtain something quite different from true derivative
56:14
just because there is a confidence interval around any point.
56:19
And obviously, there is a trade off here, as well, because you can run more paths, throw more computational power,
56:28
which will reduce your confidence interval. You will know better where you are, more precise.
56:37
Or the other solution could be, if you know that your function is not too concave and reasonably
56:45
flat, you might do the numerical differentiation
56:52
on wider interval. Basically, reducing the significance of the error, and you will hope to arrive to a better approximation.
57:00
So obviously, there is somewhere balance, and the question was,
57:05
is there an optimal shift size to get the derivative?
57:13
And that's what-- uh oh, the slide got corrupted.
57:20
So, there was quite a bit of mathematics involved and minimization and optimization.
57:26
There was an answer. And that's actually what we finally arrived at.
57:35
And that's some toy example, but still, it shows you that if you use constant size
57:41
and not optimal size, that would be your numerical derivative of this blue function.
57:49
While if you use an optimal shift size, which [INAUDIBLE] computed, it would be much smoother and much better.
57:57
So, that's one of example, and that's what he did. And we actually are implementing it in our systems and plan
58:05
to use it in practice. Another project was actually quite different.
58:14
And it was about electronic trading and basically how to better predict prices of currencies
58:27
and exchange rate. And funny enough, it was on ruble/US dollar,
58:32
because it was actually aimed for our Moscow office.
58:38
And basically, what we had, we had the noisy observation of broker data and it was coming out
58:46
at different non-uniform times. Basically, at random times.
58:52
So, we decided to use Kalman filter
58:57
and to study how it can predict. And that's one of the nice graphs [INAUDIBLE]
59:07
produced, which again, we will use this strategy
59:13
and the Kalman filters which he constructed in our e-trading platform in Moscow.
59:23
So, that's just a couple of examples, which I wanted to give you as a preview of what we
59:30
will be talking in the class. Just to remind, the website is fully functional.
59:38
We put syllabus there, a short list of literature.
59:44
We will be posting a lot of materials there. Probably most lectures will be published there.
59:51
Jake's slides are there already. So, any questions?
59:56
JAKE XIA: Please hand back the sign up sheets.
1:00:03
We like to get your emails so we can put you on the website for further announcements,
1:00:10
but you can also add yourselves. [INAUDIBLE]. But it's probably easier if you put your email
1:00:16
on the sign up sheet, so we can [INAUDIBLE]. VASILY STRELA: Yeah, but please visit and sign up here, because there will
1:00:23
be announcements to the class. Thank you very much.
