0:21
okay thank you all uh for being here so what we want to do today is introduce
0:27
two puzzles one is really going to be a war up for the main puzzle um these
0:34
puzzles are going to involve infinitely many clowns and each of them is going to
0:39
consist of a short mathematical argument which leads to some really surprising
0:46
conclusions okay so the math Behind these puzzles is going to be pretty straightforward I'm going to explain it
0:52
all in today's lecture but it turns out that thinking about what's going on in
0:57
these puzzles is quite philosophical interesting okay so let's start with our
1:04
warm-up puzzle so in our warm-up puzzle we have infinitely many
1:10
clowns and these clowns don't have unlimited Powers but they do have one
1:16
very special talent their very special talent is they can walk into a room and
1:22
they can put some balloons in that room really really quickly as quickly as you
1:28
want okay so um now we have our room uh
1:34
between and I'll tell you what goes on in this room between uh noon and 100 p.m. okay so at 100 p.m. uh clown number
1:42
one comes into the room but before that at 12:30 clown number two comes into the
1:50
room uh before that at 12:15 clown number three comes into the room before
1:57
that at 12 and uh 7 and 1/2 minutes
2:03
um um clown number four comes into the room and so on okay so just a few things
2:11
to note about this setting all infinitely many clowns come into the
2:16
room between noon and 1 p.m. and one slightly confusing uh feature of the
2:23
setup is the Clowns with the smaller numbers are going to come in later right so if you think about it for each clown
2:31
all the Clowns with larger numbers than it are going to arrive before and this
2:37
also means that when each clown comes in there have already been infinitely many
2:42
clowns that have come into the room okay now each of these clowns has a
2:50
plan and their plans all look the same uh so each clown says to themselves as
2:57
following uh when I come in into the room if there are no balloons in this
3:03
room when I come in then I'm going to put some balloons in the room and I'm going to do it quickly enough so the
3:09
balloons are already there by the time the next clown arrives okay otherwise if
3:16
there are already balloons in the room the clown doesn't put any balloon they just go home and do
3:23
nothing okay uh one side thing to note all
3:29
balloons featuring in our talk today are really really good quality balloons they're not going to pop or disappear at
3:37
any point um during our puzzles okay so sometimes we make plans
3:45
but we don't manage to follow through with them so I once planned to run a
3:51
half marathon but sadly I couldn't really find the time to train and I was
3:58
also a bit lazy and I never followed through with my plan okay but in this
4:05
case it looks like for these clowns these plans are pretty easy to carry out
4:10
right each of them just comes in at a certain time they just check if there are balloons if there aren't they put some if there already are they do
4:18
nothing um so it looks pretty easy so let's suppose that all of our clowns
4:23
have indeed um followed through with their plans
4:32
okay so I want to make uh two claims about our situation the first claim is that at
4:41
every single point at every single time between 12 and one there must be
4:48
balloons in this rout okay why is that
4:55
um um let's suppose by contradiction that there is is sometime where there
5:01
aren't any balloons in the room just suppose that's uh 12:30 okay so suppose this purple time
5:09
12:30 is a time where there are no balloons in the room and now let's think what happens in
5:16
the previous time of the series 12:15 indicated in green here okay so one
5:23
option is at 12:15 there already are balloons in this room okay
5:30
but if at 12:15 there already are balloons in this room remember I said these balloons are very resilient so if
5:37
at 12:15 there are balloons they're still going to stick around until 12:30
5:43
which contradicts our assumption that at this purple time there are no balloons
5:48
okay so there can't be balloons in the room at 1215 but now let's think what happens
5:56
when the clown of the green time in this case clown number three walks into the room at 12:15 right clown
6:03
number three remember his plan his plan is uh check if there are no balloons in
6:09
the room we've just shown there are no balloons in the room so according to the plan clown number three puts some
6:15
balloons in the room and puts them so they're there in time for 12:30 okay but
6:21
this again contradicts our assumption that there were no balloons in the room
6:26
at 12:30 okay so we've reached a contradiction either way so this shows
6:34
that there must be balloons in the room at 12:30 but of course 12:30 was just an
6:39
arbitrary time the same argument would work whichever time uh you choose so
6:45
this shows that at every time between 12 and 1 there're going to be balloons in
6:51
the room okay here's the second claim the
6:56
second claim is none of the clowns put those balloons in the room right none of
7:01
the clowns put any balloons in the room between 12 and 1 why is that well let's
7:08
just pick any arbitrary clown say clown number three coming in at 12:15 so again
7:14
remember the Clown's plans clown number three comes into the room checks if
7:20
there are balloons in the room well we know there are balloons in the room at every single time between 12 and 1 so
7:27
they going to be balloons in the room at 12 15 so according to the plan clown
7:32
number three isn't going to put in any balloons and again clown number three was just a completely arbitrary Choice
7:39
the same is going to be true of every single clown okay so if you step back a
7:45
bit you'll notice that these two claims seem to show something pretty weird
7:51
right we have these clowns all they've done is form these pretty simple plans
7:56
to come into the room check if there are balloons put them there if there aren't
8:01
any balloons and they carry out these simple plans and by doing that they have
8:08
somehow managed to ensure that there will be balloons in this room without any of them having put them there okay
8:15
that's pretty weird okay if you think this is weird wait till you get to our second
8:24
puzzle okay so here's our second puzzle in this puzzle we still have the same uh
8:30
set of infinitely many clowns they still come into the room at exactly the same
8:35
times but this time they have a slightly different uh plan okay so here's how their plans look
8:43
each clown says to themselves I'm going to come into the room and if first
8:50
there's no ice cream Mountain outside the room at noon and second no clown
8:57
that came earlier has put some balloon bons in the room then I'm going to put
9:02
some balloons in the room okay Al otherwise if they're either is an ice
9:08
cream Mountain there or some previous clown has put balloons in the room then
9:13
they won't put any balloons they won't do anything maybe this room is fun enough as it is they don't need to uh
9:20
bother with it okay so again these plans don't seem
9:27
particularly hard to follow for these clamps come into the room check these two
9:32
conditions if they apply they put some balloons otherwise they do nothing so again let's suppose they've all
9:39
succeeded in carrying out their plan okay I claim that this time it
9:46
follows that there must be an ice cream Mountain outside the room at noon okay
9:53
so the argument here is just a littleit a little bit tricky trickier but uh
10:01
let's go through it okay so let's suppose by contradiction that there is
10:07
no ice cream Mountain outside the room at noon um so we have two options right
10:15
either no clown has put any balloons between noon and one or some clown has
10:22
put in uh some balloons so I'm going to consider each of these options and show
10:28
that either way we reach a contradiction so first suppose that no clown ever puts
10:34
any balloons in the room okay so now think what happens when
10:40
for example clown number three comes in at 125 right and again remember the
10:47
plans of these clowns so this clown comes in uh she's going to check if there's no ice cream Mountain we're good
10:54
we're assuming there is no ice cream mountain and then she's going to check if no clown that came earlier has put
11:01
balloons in the room well if no clown ever puts balloons in the room then this means no clown that came before 12:15
11:09
puts balloons in the room so both of the conditions are satisfied so our clown is
11:14
going to put balloons in the room okay but this just contradicted our assumption that no clown ever puts
11:21
balloons in the room okay so this assumption has led to a contradiction so
11:26
we can rule it out what had the other option suppose that some clown uh does put uh balloons
11:36
in the room okay so let's suppose for example it's clown number uh two at uh
11:44
12:30 okay so one thing to note is we know the plans of these clowns we know
11:50
the only situation this clown would have put balloons in the room is first if there's no ice cream Mountain good
11:56
that's what we're assuming and second if they're the first to put in balloons right no clown that came in earlier has
12:04
put in any balloons okay so let's assume that's satisfied as well but now let's
12:11
think what happened at 12:15 when clown number three came in when clown number
12:18
three came in clown number three first checked there's no ice cream Mountain indeed there's no ice cream mountain and
12:25
then they checked if no clown that came earlier has put in any balloons right if
12:31
no one before 12:30 has put in any balloons then it's also true that no one
12:37
that came before 12:15 has put in any balloons okay so according to the plan
12:43
clown number three is going to put some balloons okay but that contradicts what
12:48
we said about clown number two being the very first to put in balloons okay so
12:54
this um option leads to a contradiction as well
12:59
okay so let's this was all uh a little complicated but let's summarize we
13:05
supposed that there's no icecream Mountain outside the room at noon and we showed that either way we reach a
13:12
contradiction okay so this means our assumption was wrong and there must be
13:18
an ice cream Mountain outside the room at noon but now think how weird this
13:26
conclusion seems to be right we we have again these clowns forming these simple plans about putting or not putting
13:34
balloons in the room and just by making and following through with these plans
13:39
they've managed to ensure the existence of something completely unrelated to
13:45
their powers of putting in balloons and in fact they've managed to ensure that it's going to be there before any of
13:51
them have even arrived into this room and to make things even a bit
13:57
weirder if you think about how our proof went you'll realize nothing in the proof
14:04
depended on the clause in their plan really being about ice cream mountains
14:09
right so we could easily amend their plan so that we replace the clause about ice cream mountains with a clause saying
14:17
that there is World Peace at noon and now it looks like just by forming these plans about balloons and following
14:23
through with them the clowns have managed to ensure there's World Peace at noon and to make things worse we can
14:31
even replace it with the condition that 2 + 2 equal 5 and now it looks like the
14:37
clowns have managed to ensure that 2 + 2 equals 5 okay so something seems to have
14:45
gone uh very wrong here okay so what has gone wrong the
14:52
argument was a little bit complicated maybe we made a mistake in the reasoning
14:58
I'm going to suggest that's not what went wrong the logic and Mathematics of our argument was perfectly uh impeccable
15:07
okay but this is where it's the philosophers turn to chip in and what
15:12
I'm going to claim is that when we understand what's really going on in these cases we'll first realize that
15:20
actually these conclusions are not quite as weird as they initially seem and that
15:26
realizing why they're not so weird is going to lead to some pretty important
15:31
philosophical observation so here's the first thing I think we should observe about this
15:38
puzzle okay so suppose indeed uh the clowns have managed to carry out their
15:45
plans a as we've assumed and we've just proved this entails there must be an ice
15:50
cream Mountain outside the room at noon I think part of the reason that this seems so puzzling is that we're assuming
15:58
that in this case it means that the clowns have somehow made it the case or
16:03
caused the ice cream Mountain to appear there okay but our proof didn't show any
16:10
such thing right a proof only showed that the fact that the clown succeed
16:15
entails that there is an ice cream Mountain there it doesn't show that the clowns have caused it to be there okay
16:23
and we can see the distinction between the two with a really simple example so
16:29
suppose I make a plan to kick a ball across a field at noon and suppose I
16:35
manag to carry out my plan from the fact that I succeeded we
16:41
can infer that there was a ball there and there was a field there okay but me
16:47
forming this plan or carrying out this plan didn't in any way cause the ball or
16:53
the field to be there okay the ball and the field were merely necessary
16:58
condition for My Success similarly I want to claim with
17:05
the Clown's case when the clowns succeed that entails that there must be an ice
17:11
cream mountain in the room at noon okay and when there is no ice cream Mountain
17:18
the clowns have no hope of succeeding okay but this doesn't show that when
17:23
they do succeed they have somehow caused this background condition to hold okay
17:30
so this lesson that we've just learned turns out to be very relevant to a
17:36
discussion of a problem that's much more important than an obscure puzzle about infinitely many uh clowns so some of you
17:45
may have heard about the problem of Free Will and the worry that determinism entails that we can't act freely okay
17:53
and philosophers have tried to think really hard about this problem really carefully and try to figure out is it
18:01
really true that determinism conflicts with free action okay and what I want to
18:07
talk about briefly is one very influential argument called the consequence argument that attempts to
18:14
show that there really is a conflict there really is a tension between
18:19
determinism and free action so to set things up um suppose at a certain time T
18:27
say May 1st 2024 uh I perform some action I raise my
18:33
my arm okay here's what determinism says on at least one standard understanding
18:40
of the view let s be the state of the entire universe a long time ago say
18:48
three billion years before I was born okay let L be all the laws of
18:55
physics and I really mean all the laws of physics not just the ones that our colleagues in the physics department
19:01
have already discovered but all the true laws that are there to be discovered um
19:08
what determinism says that the conjunction of the state of the universe at this early time and the laws of
19:15
physics together entail everything that happens in the universe throughout history including the fact that I raise
19:23
my arm atti so now supposed determinism is true
19:28
and ask yourself if it's true could I have acted any differently at T could I
19:35
have not raised my arm at T okay so the consequence argument
19:43
attempts to answer this with a no if determinism is true I could not have uh
19:49
failed to raise my arm at T and here's why the thought is this look if
19:56
determinism tells us that the conjunction of SNL entailed that I raise my arm then if there's some situation
20:04
some possibility where I don't raise my arm at T that means that's a situation
20:09
where the conjunction of SN L are false okay so this means that if I
20:16
manage to act differently if I manage to not raise my arms I've somehow managed
20:21
to make it the case that the conjunction of SNL is false okay but it doesn't look
20:28
like I have any such Powers right I can't control what happened in the
20:33
universe three billion years before I was born and sadly I also cannot control
20:39
what the laws of physics are like so it really looks like this is something I can't do uh so the argument concludes
20:46
this shows that I really could not have acted any differently which on a certain
20:52
understanding might make you think that my action wasn't free Okay so this is a very compelling
21:00
argument uh but I'm going to suggest that our discussion of the clown puzzle
21:05
should tell you there's a crucial flaw in this argument so to know the crucial flaw I
21:12
want you to focus on this premise that if I manage to act differently then I
21:17
manage to make S Plus L false okay and I want to remind you of
21:24
the lesson we learned from the clowns okay so what's let's be clear what
21:30
determinism tells us is that if I don't raise my arm at T that inails that the
21:37
conjunction of S Plus L is false but that does not mean that in that
21:42
possibility where I don't raise my arm I have somehow caused it or made it the
21:48
case that s+ L is false okay so again
21:53
remember actions can have necessary conditions uh for the success in order
22:00
to kick the ball there has to be a ball there in order for the clowns to carry out their plans there has to be an ice
22:07
cream mountain and in order for me to raise my to not raise my arm at T it has
22:13
to be the case that the conjunction of S and L is false but it doesn't mean that
22:19
when it is false I have somehow made it the case that it's false okay there is a
22:26
lot more to say about the problem of Free Will and there might well be other
22:32
Arguments for thinking that Free Will and determinism are
22:37
incompatible um but this argument at least uh is very problematic so our
22:45
discussion so far focused on the case where things go well for the clowns right there was an ice cream Mountain
22:51
outside the room and that meant they were able to carry out their plans but I
22:56
now want to focus on the other case right the case where there was no ice cream Mountain outside the room at noon
23:04
okay so we know from our proof that this means that the clowns did not all
23:10
succeed in carrying out their plans okay at least some of them uh must have
23:19
failed but this raises a really puzzling question the question is uh what exactly
23:28
is preventing them from succeeding right remember these plans are really easy to carry out each of them comes into the
23:35
room checks if there's no ice cream Mountain checks if someone else has put in balloons otherwise they put uh some
23:42
balloons in right what like they're coming into the room they're trying to
23:47
carry out the plan what is is there some special you know magical forest that
23:53
they're trying to put their balloons and it's preventing them uh or maybe there is a sort of Officer of the logic police
24:01
rushing in uh to stop them from carrying out their
24:06
plans okay and just to see how puzzling this is I do want to note that this
24:12
contrasts with my analogy of the case of planning to kick the ball okay so
24:18
similarly we know that if I plan to kick the a ball and there's no ball there I'm G to fail but in that case it's very
24:25
easy to explain why I'm going to fail right what's stopping me for kicking a ball there's no ball there very easy to
24:33
understand right in this case it's hard to understand what's making these clowns
24:39
fail okay so to better understand what's going on here I want to focus on a
24:46
slightly uh simpler case so this case will only have two
24:51
clowns um and here's the plan of clown number one clown number one plans to
24:58
ensure that at noon there are exactly three balloons in the room here's what clown number two plans
25:06
uh clown number two plans to ensure that there are exactly two balloons in the
25:11
room at noon okay now I want you to put your hand up if you think they're both
25:17
going to succeed in their plan they're both going to manage to follow through okay I want you to put your hand
25:24
up if you think at least one of them is going to fail in the their plan okay good so you're all right uh we
25:33
know that at least one of them is definitely going to fail in the plan but
25:38
here's the following question which of these clowns is going to fail in this
25:44
plan so put your hand up if you think it's clown number one that's going to fail okay put your hand up if you think
25:52
it's clown number two that's going to fail okay
26:00
uh okay put your hand out if you think it's complicated or we're not sure or
26:06
okay good so the answer is we can't
26:11
really tell right there aren't enough uh fact in the description of the case
26:16
right we know that at least one of them is going to fail but we don't know which one and we also don't know why and there
26:22
are lots of different ways for this story to unfold right um
26:28
maybe they both come into the room at the same time really determined to carry
26:34
out their plans and they're having a sort of wrestling match to see which one wins over and clown number one is
26:41
stronger and manages to carry out their plans or maybe as they were rushing to
26:47
the room towards the room at noon a green monster came and abducted clown number one so they never made it to the
26:55
room okay but there also some very undramatic ways they can fail right they
27:01
can both arrive to the room at noon and clown number one suddenly remembered
27:06
that she's really hungry and decided to go off and buy a pizza or maybe they
27:13
both arrived to the room at noon but clown number two was really tired and fell asleep before they had a chance to
27:21
carry out their plans okay there can be many many many ways this story could go
27:27
the only thing we know from the logic of the situation is that there's one way
27:32
this story is not going to go They're not going to both succeed in their plan
27:38
so back to our ice cream Mountain I want to suggest that exactly the same thing
27:45
is true of our clowns right we know from the logic of the situation that if
27:51
there's no ice cream Mountain okay at least some of the clowns are going to
27:56
fail but there are many many different reasons they might fail right some of them are dramatic like a monster abducts
28:04
clown number 452 just before they come into the room
28:09
uh but there are also some very boring things that can happen right clown number
28:15
7,3 might get hungry and go buy pizza or fall asleep before they manage to carry
28:22
out their plans again here too there are many different ways for this story to un
28:28
fold the only thing we know from the logic of the case that did not happen is
28:33
that they did not all manage to carry out their plans in this case too it
28:40
turns out this lesson namely that there are many different ways for the Clans to
28:45
fail turns out really important for another very interesting philosophical
28:50
puzzle this time concerning uh time travel so this is called the grandfather
28:57
Paradox and it go like this okay so consider this guy Tim uh Tim is a young
29:04
man in 2020 here is Tim 20 years uh earlier being born so he's a baby and his mom is
29:12
holding him um here is Tim's mom being born so
29:17
now Tim's mom is the baby and the guy holding her is Tim's maternal
29:23
grandfather uh and here is Tim's grandfather uh a few years before before
29:28
Tim's mom as a Young Man a few years before Tim's mom uh is born okay so back
29:34
to 2020 here's Tim in 2020 he's thinking about his maternal
29:39
grandfather and Tim really really hates his grandfather he hates him so much
29:46
that he decides to take a very extreme measure okay so the extreme measure is
29:51
he builds a time machine uh he takes a gun with him uh and he travels back in
29:59
time all the way back to 1975 where he plans to kill
30:05
grandfather okay so suppose he's practiced he has his gun he's a really good chart he's practiced this he
30:12
travels back in time and manages to kill grandfather well now we have a problem
30:18
because if Tim killed grandfather in 1975 then uh Tim's Mother wasn't born in
30:27
1980 and Tim wasn't born in 2000 and so Tim isn't around in 2020 to
30:35
form all this plan about building a time machine so in fact he never built a time machine and traveled back in time so no
30:43
one traveled back in time and killed grandfather Okay so we've reached a
30:53
contradiction okay so the conclusion is we can just tell from the logic of the
30:58
situation that there's no way that Tim Tim succeeded in traveling back in time
31:04
and killing grandfather but here is the puzzle why didn't he succeed why can't Tim travel
31:11
back in time and kill grandfather what's stopping him okay so one very obvious
31:17
answer you might have at the stage is unlike the clowns plan which were very
31:22
simple this is quite a complicated plan right it's quite hard to build a time machine and travel back in time so one
31:29
thing that might be stopping him is you just can't travel back in time okay and
31:35
indeed many philosophers have concluded from this puzzle that what it shows is
31:41
that time travel is impossible okay but the logic of the situation doesn't quite
31:46
force that conclusion on us right it doesn't say that it's impossible to travel back in time it just says that if
31:53
Tim travels back in time and attempts to kill grandfather Tim is not going to
32:01
succeed so let's suppose Tim really did uh travel back in time again we're faced
32:07
with this worry why is it that he can't succeed what's going to stop him is it
32:14
that when he shoots grandfather there's going to be a special force stopping the bullet midair or again the sort of logic
32:22
police will rush off to arrest him just before um he manages to shoot
32:30
grandfather so remember the lesson we just had from the clown puzzle right
32:37
what that lesson tells us is that there are many different ways that Tim can
32:42
fail some of them might be as dramatic as a police woman rushing in and
32:47
knocking Tim over just as he's about to kill grandfather but there could be many many very boring reasons right his gun
32:55
gets jammed or grandfather's train is late and he just misses the shot or all
33:02
sorts of different mundane things can happen Okay the story can unfold in many
33:07
many different ways the only thing the logic of the situation tells us is there
33:13
is one way it's not going to unfold it will not unfold by Tim in fact killing
33:19
grandfather okay let's move to our uh final lesson so when people hear about this
33:27
clown puzzle a very common reaction is to think that this shows that there's
33:32
something really mysterious and spooky about Infinity okay and to be fair the
33:39
logic of our puzzle really did depend on there being infinitely many clowns okay so let's just quickly see why suppose we
33:47
had exactly the same puzzle except now we have finit many clowns say three
33:53
clowns okay and they make the same plans um now we're not going to be able to
33:59
prove that there must be an ice cream Mountain there right suppose there's no ice cream Mountain there's going to be
34:04
no contradiction we'll just have clown number three is going to be the first one to come in at 12:15 they're going to
34:11
check no ice cream Mountain good they're going to check that no clown that came earlier put any balloons there weren't
34:17
any clowns earlier fine they're going to put some balloons then at 12:30 clown
34:24
number two is going to come in they're going to see someone else has already put some balloons they're going to do nothing at one clown number one is going
34:32
to come in they're going to see some earlier clown has already put up some balloons they're going to do nothing and
34:38
that's it right no contradiction everything is fine uh we can't conclude
34:44
that there has to be an ice cream Mountain okay so our original puzzle really depended on us having infinitely
34:51
many clowns but I want to suggest that there are variants of this puzzle that
34:58
involve um only finitely many clowns okay so here's a variant
35:06
um here's a variant that involves just two clowns okay so clown
35:14
uh o sorry okay so we have just two clowns
35:22
and clown number one plans to ensure that at noon I either there is an ice
35:28
cream Mountain outside the room or there are exactly three balloons in the room
35:34
okay meanwhile clown number two plans to ensure that either there's an ice cream
35:39
mountain in the room at noon or there are exactly two balloons in the room at
35:44
noon okay and it follows from the fact if both these clowns succeed in carrying
35:52
out the their plans right it's going to follow that there must be an ice cream Mountain outside the room at noon why is
35:59
that well suppose there's no ice cream Mountain well the only way the first
36:04
clown succeed can succeed in their plan right the green Clause isn't being
36:09
satisfied so the only way they could succeed is via the blue Claws by ensuring there are three balloons in the
36:16
room at noon and for clown number two if clown number two is going to succeed
36:21
well the green Clause isn't satisfied so the only way for them to succeed is to ensure they're exactly two balloons in
36:28
the room at noon right but there can't be exactly two balloons and also exactly
36:34
three balloons in the room so that's a contradiction so there must be an ice cream Mountain outside the room and okay
36:42
so if you think about it this simple puzzle essentially has the same logic of
36:48
our puzzle with infinitely many clowns right what's really going on in the puzzle with infinitely many clowns is
36:55
that the clowns start out with plans that are basically inconsistent
37:01
with each other um unless right we just have this sort of Escape Clause where if
37:07
there is an ice cream Mountain uh there that's uh
37:13
fine okay so you might say well hang on this was a little bit uh too easy right
37:22
because in my puzzle with the two clowns uh the two clowns are trying to ensure
37:28
that incompatible things happen in the room at the very same time right so we
37:34
understand what's going to go wrong there right so if there's no ice cream Mountain there things are going to be incompatible and we know what's going to
37:40
go wrong right they both come at noon one of them is trying to make sure there are two balloons one of them is trying
37:46
to make sure they're three balloons both these things can't happen at noon
37:52
okay isn't what's puzzling about the original puzzle is that these clowns
37:58
come into the room at different times right they're not clashing with each other each of them is entering the rooms
38:04
and trying to put some balloons at a different time okay so I want to say two things
38:11
about that one is remember our previous lesson from the previous lesson we know
38:17
that some of the reasons that clowns can fail is not just because another clown is sort of jostling them at the same
38:25
time right there are many many reason they can fail that might have nothing to do uh with the other clowns uh but I
38:34
also want to say uh this in addition that we can also have variants of the
38:39
puzzle that have finitely many clowns and these clowns are going to try to do
38:44
things at different times okay so let's quickly see a version of that so this
38:50
version two will have only two clowns uh so clown number one comes in at sorry
38:56
clown number two comes in at noon and clown number one comes in at one and
39:03
here are their plants clown number one plans to put balloons in the room if and
39:08
only if clown number two puts balloons in the room and clown number two plans
39:15
to put balloons in the room if and only if clown number one does not put balloons in the room okay so if you
39:23
think about it they cannot both succeed in their plans right so B basically clown one wants them to do the same
39:30
thing either for both of them to put balloons or for both of them to refrain from putting balloons and clown number
39:36
two wants them to do different things so these plans are incompatible they can't
39:42
both succeed and in this case the plans are just uh inconsistent but you can by
39:48
now see how to construct a variant of this where instead we tweak their plant
39:53
so there's an escape Clause with an ice cream Mountain and then they could succeed but that would entail that there
40:01
is an ice cream mountain in the room okay so we seem to have a variance of the puzzle where the finally many clowns
40:07
they come in at different times and we're still going to ensure there's an ice cream mountain in the
40:13
room okay you might think this still isn't quite as good as our puzzle with
40:19
infinitely many clowns right um so here's one thing that was weird about
40:24
the original puzzle in the original puzzle every clown when they walked into the
40:29
room their plan only depended on conditions that already happened in the past right they only needed to check
40:37
whether there was an ice cream Mountain there earlier and whether earlier clowns have put balloons but in this case we
40:44
have one clown clown number two that makes a plan that depends on something
40:49
that's going to happen in the future right it depends on what clown number one is going to do in the future so you
40:55
might think this is a bit dodgy maybe the only way for clown number two to carry out this plan is to consult a
41:02
fortune teller I'm going to let you in on a little secret it's not just Infinity
41:09
that's not that special it's also fortune tellers that are actually not that special uh so in fact all of you
41:19
have fantastic abilities uh to uh tell
41:25
some things that are going to happen in the future and we make plans all the time dependent
41:32
on future events okay so some days I am
41:38
trying to decide whether to cook dinner or not but my partner left a message on
41:43
the fridge saying that he will cook dinner tonight so I know based on this
41:48
future event that he will cook dinner tonight I decide not to cook dinner um
41:55
earlier in the day okay and I just checked and noticed the future event
42:02
tomorrow it will be Friday and I will be teaching a class so based on these
42:08
future events I'm now going to prepare my class for tomorrow okay so we make
42:16
plans in this way all the time and exactly the same thing might be true of these clowns right so clown number two
42:24
might have a lot of very mundane way to determine what clown number one is going
42:29
to do okay maybe clown one which is a very trustworthy clown left a note on
42:35
the fridge promising they're going to put balloons on the fridge at one or
42:41
maybe clown number two has just found out that uh clown number one has
42:48
recently developed a severe allergy to balloons so they're sure when clown number one is going to come in at one
42:54
they're not going to put in any B okay so I think this puzzle is actually
43:01
not that different from our puzzle about infinitely many clowns okay so the
43:08
conclusion is that the original puzz wasn't really essentially about
43:14
Infinity I do think Infinity played a role in the puzzle but I think it played
43:19
a psychological role it played a role in why we found it so puzzling and the
43:25
reason we found it so puzzling is that when we have just two clowns it's very
43:31
easy for us to see that their plans are inconsistent with each other or maybe inconsistent unless there's an ice cream
43:38
Mountain but we're not that good at reasoning about Infinity when we have infinitely many clowns it takes us more
43:45
work to figure out what's going on and we don't immediately see that their plans are just inconsistent with each
43:53
other okay so this bring me to brings me to the end uh of our lecture we're going
43:59
to uh take a few questions but before I do so I'm going to add one more slide
44:05
that has a few reading suggestions of some of the academic literature on these
44:10
topics in case any of you want to chase that up um okay I'll finish
44:19
