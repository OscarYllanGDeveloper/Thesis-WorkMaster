0:02
[Music]
0:12
so I said I would say what um reduced ralon form really is and it's the
0:17
following so the first
0:23
nonzero in any row in a row oh in a row is is is one
0:34
right all
0:39
entries above and
0:46
below a leading one that is a one at the both on zero
0:53
and a row are zero all entries above and below one of
0:59
these ones are zero in that
1:10
column the leading one
1:18
okay in a row is in a
1:27
column to the right
1:34
of any leading one in a row above right of [Music]
1:40
any leading
1:47
one okay in a row
1:54
above okay and finally any all
2:03
zero rows okay come
2:11
below nonzero
2:19
rows okay okay so I just have in my mind
2:26
these rules sound a little complicated but there's sufficient um here's a matrix in reduced
2:34
R Echelon form so if we have a one there then we have to have zeros in the same
2:39
column below it and then if we have one there then we have to have zeros in the same column above and below it and then
2:48
we might have another number here so I put minus 27 27 was obviously my favorite number
2:55
that day okay and then I put 15 up here so that was my second favorite number that
3:02
day okay and then we might have a zero here and a zero here and then if we have a one there so
3:10
you see the ones are moving to the right be moving to the right then I have to have zeros in that
3:16
column okay and then I might have something like four five six I was running out of
3:24
inspiration for numbers and zero at the bottom here and we might have something
3:30
like seven 8 n so the value of the numbers I put in this Matrix apart from
3:36
the ones which are one are clearly completely arbitrary this is just an
3:43
example that satisfies these rules above you go along any Row the first
3:50
thing you hit is a one if you have a one at leading row
3:57
then above and below it are zeros okay and if you have a one in this row
4:03
then it must be to the right of the one in this row and any all zero rows come right at
4:10
the bottom this is a reduced row Eon form
4:22
okay so this will be useful um on the problem sheet but it'll also
4:28
be useful a little bit later when we come to do other things
4:38
okay so today I'm going to talk a little bit about to start with about Matrix
4:48
algebra Okay so we've seen yesterday that we have
4:56
matrices so here's our Matrix let's give it a name a and it has entries and I'm going to have
5:01
an entry a one one as the first entry and a one 2 as the first second entry in
5:11
the first row and so on and then this goes up to a one and I've called it
5:17
n okay and then the next row will be
5:23
a21 and a22 and so on up to A2 n
5:30
some people put commas between these indices I'm not doing so this is not
5:37
a12 this is a sub12
5:42
right and then the last row in my Matrix here will be a
5:50
M1 and am M2 and up to a
5:58
MN well I can't really put that one in that's not really fair okay so here is a matrix so if a i
6:07
j is a real number okay this is a
6:14
real M by n
6:19
Matrix okay in other words it has M
6:25
rows and N columns
6:31
right the first index is sort of the row index and the second index is the column
6:38
index okay okay so we
6:45
say that a belongs to r m cross
6:52
n so that's the notation that I would use so sometimes you'll also see
7:00
um a in M and N which I like
7:08
less but that notation you'll see means exactly the same as this notation which I think is a little bit more
7:17
descriptive okay so note
7:23
that um r m cross1
7:30
okay these are column
7:37
vectors these are column vectors
7:45
okay with M
7:54
entries and R 1 cross n
8:01
are row vectors
8:07
with
8:21
n and then what about algebra if a and b
8:27
are both matrices with the same number of rows and
8:32
columns okay then C The Matrix which you get by
8:39
adding a to B is defined as follows well first of all let me say that this has
8:46
entries b i j just like in a above in other words if I put b equals and I
8:53
Chang all the little A's to Little B's it would be the thing
8:58
right and this C is going to have entries you
9:03
guess it right this is going to have entries c i j as in a
9:11
above okay so Cal a plus b is
9:18
defined by C J equals a i
9:25
j plus b i j okay well this is pretty easy right
9:32
every index I equal 1 up to M and index J equal 1 up to
9:41
n okay so that's sort of the most obvious thing isn't
9:48
it Define addition of two
9:53
matrices okay and
10:02
because uh real addition addition I'll say
10:08
addition of real numbers addition real
10:15
numbers commutes that means you can do it either
10:22
way around right because addition of real numbers commutes
10:28
also C is equal to B +
10:35
a because B plus AIG is the same as AIG
10:40
plus b so the commutativity of real numbers
10:45
leads to the commut commutativity of Matrix
10:51
addition okay lots of coughing this morning is
10:56
everybody had a drink before they come in right it's nice to hear silence I'm not criticizing I've had a
11:04
cough for two weeks but anyway it's nice if it was okay um so Matrix this should be a
11:13
capital M Matrix
11:18
addition is also well first of all it's
11:25
um associative
11:35
so that simply means that um if a B and
11:42
C are matrices with the same numbers of rows and columns and rows rows and
11:48
columns sorry M rows and N columns um
11:56
then if I add a to B and then add
12:03
C okay then that's the same as adding B to C and then adding
12:11
a
12:16
okay and so there's no
12:23
ambiguity in writing
12:34
a plus b plus C in other words I don't need to put these brackets into indicate
12:41
the order in which I do these these additions
12:46
okay okay let me also say that um if
12:51
Alpha is a real number um and a is a real M by n
13:00
Matrix um just like we've got here
13:06
right then uh Alpha time a is defined to
13:14
be Alpha time a11 and Alpha time a12 and
13:20
Alpha time A1 n and Alpha time
13:27
a21 alp a22 and Alpha time
13:32
a2n and Alpha time a
13:37
M1 a you've got the
13:42
idea okay so that's what scalar multiplication of a matrix
13:52
means um and then I'll say uh also that clearly uh The Matrix
14:02
which I shall call zero okay which is a real n byn
14:10
Matrix and this has all zero
14:17
entries right is if you were populate an N byn Matrix with every entry equal
14:24
zero uh clearly this guy satisfies
14:30
that Z plus a is equal to is equal to
14:36
a okay for
14:42
all a is in the right side
14:53
okay so in other words the addition of matrices is quite easy quite straightforward and it follows all the
14:58
the rules that you would expect in some sense how could you define it differently you couldn't really Define it
15:07
differently matrix multiplication on the other hand is a little more
15:18
complicated okay so matrix multiplication as opposed to Matrix addition okay
15:24
so here I'm going to take positive integers
15:32
I'm going to take positive inches and I call them um uh m n and
15:40
p i don't like using small o as an integer so I've called it P so if a
15:47
belongs to r m cross P okay and B belongs to r p cross
16:01
n so this has M rows and P columns and this has P rows and M N columns
16:10
right then a * B which is called
16:17
C and again times I write with no symbol as we do usually right a * zal C this
16:26
guy belongs to R M cross n okay is
16:35
defined defined by c j c
16:42
j c i j now I got not going to spit it in there write it on the next board c i
16:51
j is equal to the sum and this is the sum this is the symbol for summing
16:56
things up we sum k a = 1 up to P of a i
17:04
k that's the i k entry of a times B KJ
17:11
that's the KJ entry of B right and this I can also write as a i vector and I've
17:20
made a very explicit defin um thing here which I'll show you what I mean dotted with B J Vector okay okay this is I = 1
17:31
up to M and J = 1 up to
17:37
n okay on the next [Music]
17:42
board where I've also written The Matrix a as its rows so A1
17:53
Vector A2 Vector a what's this this is M right M
18:02
Vector so I'm writing it like that so you can think this is a vector right it just populates this
18:08
row and B I correspondingly write as B1
18:14
Vector that's a column vector and B2 Vector up to
18:20
BN vector and what's the point here the point here is that the AI vector
18:29
are in r one cross P I reckon the column
18:36
they're row vectors I'm sorry with P entries so a is
18:42
in r m cross P so that means it has M rows and P columns and so if I write it
18:49
in this form as vectors then each of these vectors is of length p and it's a row Vector so I write it like this and
18:56
correspondingly BJ is in our P cross one it's a column vector and
19:04
because B is in r p cross n that means it has P rows and N columns well you can
19:11
see the N columns but the P rows mean that each of these vectors is of length P which is why I can write this as the
19:20
dot product I hope you all saw this rather important dot here of the I row of x
19:28
a times the J column of B this do proba perectly well defined
19:36
because these are both P vectors right if they're of different
19:41
lengths if one had 15 entries the other had 17 then there's no way you can Define the dot product or at least I've
19:47
not defined it yet but if they're both P vectors then I can Define the dot prod so I'm just
19:53
trying to get you to think in slightly different ways this is a way of defining
19:58
the product of two matrices okay so you need the length to
20:05
add up so I'm defining matrix multiplication just like I defined at Matrix addition above for particular
20:12
sizes and if the sizes don't work then you cannot Define these
20:17
operations so you can't add a 3X two Matrix to a 9 by7 Matrix that doesn't
20:23
make sense right in the way that I've just defined it
20:29
and similarly you can't multiply two matrices for which the number of rows of
20:34
this Matrix is not sorry the number of columns of this Matrix is not equal to
20:40
the number of rows of that Matrix okay
20:47
examples so let's have some examples first of all if a is equal to one two Z
20:53
and minus one let's say so this is in
20:59
r 1 cross 4 okay and B is equal to I
21:06
chosen three 0 2 and minus one so this
21:11
is in our full cross one okay then
21:18
AB which is C is
21:26
precisely sorry four somebody can do Ari right this is four and this is in r one
21:32
cross one which we don't identify more specifically than
21:37
it's the real numbers if you want to put R1 cross
21:45
one I don't mind okay so this is just the dot
21:55
product of two vectors of a row
22:05
vector and a Col
22:14
Vector that's example number one example number two here we are we
22:20
have a matrix one one 2 - one 2 - one
22:28
so this is a 2x3 Matrix okay and if I take b as equal to
22:36
the vector XY Z then this is sort of what we've
22:41
already seen C is equal [Music] to x + y + 2
22:51
Z right and - x + 2 y - Z
23:01
okay so that's what we've already seen right I've already written systems of equations essentially by using this
23:07
before defining it but I just point one thing out to you here that you can perhaps not thought about as well as
23:14
thinking of this as being you know the dot product of this Vector with this Vector to give that Vector to give that
23:20
scalar I'm sorry and then the dotproduct of this Vector with this Vector to give this
23:26
scalar you can also think of this as x times the first column of this
23:33
Matrix plus y * the second column of this Matrix plus Z times the third column so
23:40
you can see x - x y + 2 y 2 Z minus
23:48
Z so that's another way of
23:53
Ching alternative alternative ways are sometimes useful that's all
23:59
okay that's example number two example number three is just um if I take oh I
24:05
taking the same Matrix one one two right so this this is a I'm sorry this is a
24:11
and this is a again minus one 2 - one I must have liked that Matrix when I was
24:16
doing these examples and B is equal to the Matrix 3
24:23
-1 Min -1 and four and 2 and-
24:29
two then the product of these matrices a * B is perfectly well defined and this
24:35
is equal to then C the product AAL C is just a
24:41
matrix well I reckon it's 6 - one -
24:49
7 and 11 again no cleverness in this choice of
24:56
numbers
25:03
okay so that's matrix multiplication defined so what are the properties
25:09
matrix
25:14
multiplication okay is first of all it is
25:25
associative and that means that a times b c or if you mean what it means
25:33
is multiply B by C first and then multiply on the front by a is the same
25:41
as multiplying a by B A * B and then multiplying on the back with C
25:49
okay and soorry in other words the brackets are not
25:55
needed okay if you have products it's also
26:06
distributive and that just means that a times well you do B plus C first then
26:13
you premultiply by a that's equal to a B
26:19
plus a c if all of these things are defined if
26:24
the dimensions are correct that all these things are defined otherwise it's simply not defined right and this is uh
26:32
also true that a + b multiplied by
26:38
C is a c plus b
26:44
c so Matrix solution is distributive but it's not
26:53
commutative okay so it's not commutative in in other words a * B is not equal to
27:02
B * a in
27:07
general okay so you simply can't change the order of the multiplication arbitrarily and you can see in all of
27:13
these rules I've not changed the order right
27:19
here um so you can also see from this that um a b equals z
27:28
so if this is M by P and this is p by n this is M by n this is the zero Matrix
27:34
of all zero entries this does not imply that a equals
27:40
z or b equals 0 okay so this does not imply that and you only need to think of
27:48
very simple examples to realize that that is true so if I take the non-zero Matrix
27:54
this and I take b as the non-zero Matrix
28:00
this then the product of these two matrices is zero so neither of these matrices are themselves
28:10
zero
28:15
okay okay very important Matrix here is a matrix I call I and so does everybody
28:21
else an i as this Matrix it has a one on the diagonal and then it has zeros in
28:26
the remaining row and the remaining columns and then it has a one and then it has
28:32
zeros and I don't know how many zeros I should put in here but this is a one and
28:38
this is a zero so this is just a matrix of which
28:46
the diagonal entry a i i as it were is one and any off diag entry a i j where I
28:53
J are different is zero this is a square Matrix right so this has to be be a real
28:58
and in this case I'm doing an N byn Matrix right did I put n byn okay this a
29:03
real n byn Matrix so it has n rows and N columns so that's why I can do do this dashed line there is a very definite
29:12
diagonal okay um this this is the n byn
29:23
identity the identity Matrix
29:31
okay satisfies by the simple rules of a
29:36
matrix multiplication I have above a * I is equal to I times a okay for all
29:52
a and this is equal to a I should say
30:00
so there is a matrix which you can multiply something by both on the on the right and on the
30:07
left which preserves The Matrix and that's this guy if you just look at the
30:12
rules of of matrix
30:23
multiplication um so because
30:28
it's not commutative multiplication is not
30:34
commutative great difficulty with these words because it's not commutative then
30:43
AB is premultiplication
30:54
premultiplication of B by
31:00
a or post
31:11
multiplication an L of a by B so you can either say that I take
31:19
a and I post multiply by b or I take B and I pre- multiply by a okay those are
31:25
different things and the only thing I'll say finally which I will do on this
31:31
board okay is that clearly um for a in r n cross n so this
31:42
is a square Matrix again as was I and so on for a square Matrix um a * a is
31:52
perfectly well defined and this we write as a squ that means a * a is matrix
31:59
multiplication okay and this is a clearly a n byn Matrix it works for
32:04
square Matrix for sure and a * a * a we've already seen I don't need any
32:10
brackets to say which I do first this is a cubed and this is in r n cross n as
32:18
well okay so these are
32:26
unambiguous in other words I can write a to the 17 and that just means
32:33
you take the Matrix a if it's square and you multiply it by itself 17 instances 16
32:40
multiplications okay uh we also Define a to the power
32:49
Z to be this special Matrix I that I've identified here okay
32:58
that's rather like saying x to the 0 is one in a scalar
33:04
context so that if we have a polinomial p of X is
33:14
equal to a0 plus a1x plus and I've done a k thee
33:21
polinomial here a KX to the k okay
33:28
so we saw these in the complex numbers introduction course
33:34
okay so if you have a polinomial in a variable X then you can necessarily
33:40
easily Define a polinomial in The Matrix a and the polinomial in a is the same
33:47
coefficient a Zer to scalar times the identity that's a to the zero plus A1 *
33:55
a plus a 2 * a 2 plus plus a k * a to
34:02
the power K and this is a
34:08
matrix polinomial
34:24
okay sorry you guys have difficulties okay I'll hold it push it up for a little bit
34:31
I'll bring it down
34:43
later so this is just defining what we do with matrices right we can add them we can therefore subtract
34:50
them we can multiply them and then the question arises about can we
34:58
divide them
35:03
right and so up over
35:11
here a question uh which arises
35:19
arising
35:25
throughout
35:31
mathematics but much more generally than this throughout science and
35:43
engineering okay is the following if you've
35:48
got a matrix a which is
35:54
square right has to be a square Matrix and then the question is does there
36:02
exist a matrix B of the same Dimension it would have to
36:08
be the same Dimension to make for this to make sense such
36:14
that AB equals the identity Matrix and that's
36:20
the same as ba okay
36:27
so if you give me a matrix is there a matrix B which I can multiply by a to
36:32
get me to this identity Matrix okay okay
36:40
any such
36:45
b is an
36:51
inverse and we denote the inverses a
36:57
is to the power of minus one okay so for example if you've got n
37:05
equal 2 and I start off with a generic Matrix a b c d where these are just
37:14
numbers then if this is a we can see by
37:21
construction that if I do the following I put D here and a there just I swap
37:27
these two over and I negate these guys here but don't move them and divide all
37:35
of this by a D minus BC so here's a scaler times a
37:42
matrix so we know what that means that means you multiply every entry of the matrix by this
37:48
number then you can see that this is a minus BC oh already minus BC so the one
37:54
one entry is one okay and DB minus BD oh that's zero so this
38:02
is indeed the identity Matrix
38:07
okay and so that means that this guy is an
38:14
inverse okay but you can note that this guy here
38:21
exists okay if and only
38:27
only if if and only if um you can actually divide by ad
38:35
minus BC in other words a minus BC cannot be zero otherwise this division
38:41
is simply not defined
38:47
okay okay a inverse
38:54
exists okay a inverse exists
39:00
means that a is well people use either the word
39:08
invertible or the word that I prefer is non
39:15
singular okay that a to inverse does not
39:25
exist means a
39:31
is singular people less often say not invertible but I shall use the word
39:40
singular when a matrix a does not have an inverse
39:47
okay okay so now I get to the first
39:54
um proposition of my course right so here's a proposition right it just says
40:00
that for a and b being real n byn
40:09
matrices okay there are some n byn matrices of real numbers some of you might have realized
40:15
already that I could have substituted this r with a c and then I'd have matrices made up of
40:22
complex entries or indeed I can do that with lots of other SoCal Fields we'll come to
40:29
that in a second so let's think about reals at the moment because it makes life easy for a and reals first of all
40:35
the first result is if a inverse
40:40
exists okay then it is
40:47
unique okay so if a matrix has an inverse then it can't have a different
40:55
inverse um the second result says that if you take a and you try and invert it
41:02
so a * B is perfectly well defined for two square matrices and if you the invert this this
41:10
is equal to the inverse of B times the inverse of a in that order this is if a
41:17
inverse and B inverse exist
41:24
okay this is rather important because it tells me that the the product of
41:29
invertible matrices is invertible
41:37
right the product of invertible matrices is invertible and the third item I shall
41:43
put in this proposition tells me that the inverse of the inverse so I had to put a
41:49
bracket in here to make this make sense clearly the inverse of the inverse is
41:56
the The Matrix a itself okay so
42:02
let's provide some proof of these things so let's prove a you uniqueness first of
42:11
all suppose that B and C which are
42:18
different okay are
42:23
both inverses of a
42:35
okay then I just say by
42:41
associativity then it must be true that b a
42:50
c equals b a c of course right but then
42:56
I can put brackets in wherever I wish and if I put brackets around a and c and
43:01
I put brackets around B * a
43:08
okay well hang on a second B is an inverse of a so B * a is the identity
43:15
Matrix and C is an inverse of a so a * C is the identity Matrix and so this tells
43:23
me that b is equal to C okay because of
43:38
this so in other words if B and C are both
43:43
inverses then they're actually the same I didn't have to put in this logic
43:51
not equal to here but I'm just trying to make it completely explicit for those of you a little less you know a little less
43:58
sure about this if I have B comma C which are both inverses then this argument still
44:05
works right I'm just explicitly saying to make it sound a little more coal you
44:12
they're different then they can't be different they have to be the same okay two
44:20
um uh is I'm going to um ask you to see
44:25
the uh problem sheet because this is on the problem sheet so you can think about
44:32
this proving my proposition number
44:37
two and three just says that well a
44:42
inverse time a is equal the identity is equal to a *
44:48
a inverse
44:54
okay so by the first proposition a is equal to a inverse
45:03
inverse in other words the inverse of this Matrix is a and
45:22
a okay so that finishes my uh prop
45:28
position I guess one of the reasons that people think about inverses if a
45:36
inverse exists okay
45:42
then the solution
45:47
X in our n CR 1 okay of a * X equal B where B is in
46:00
our n + 1 so in other words x and V are both n column
46:06
vectors okay is X is equal to a inverse time
46:24
B
46:30
I mean this is a slightly trivial statement but it's just sometimes people like to say this so the question of
46:35
whether this in inverse exists relates to whether there
46:41
are is a unique solution X of a system of equations well yesterday we looked at
46:47
systems of equations and we looked at whether there were what kinds of solutions there were
46:55
so in the first example I gave you there was a unique solution so in that situation you would expect that I could
47:02
have written down a matrix inverse okay I'll come over
47:11
here oh I've only got a a couple of minutes
47:22
um yeah it's not it's not really worth me um starting on the next bit for just a couple of
47:29
minutes so I'll I'll stop there today
47:48
it's
