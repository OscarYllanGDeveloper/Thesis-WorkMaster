0:05
okay so I'm back and so now we move on
0:12
building on what we have learned of classical mechanics and we move on to to
0:19
the next subject traditionally in classical physics where classical means non quanto okay you know
0:27
that classical physics roughly classical mechanics electrodynamics that is what we are going to learn is what we are
0:36
going to do now and then usually it's thermodynamics or statistical mechanics
0:43
that probably you don't do you do you have a class on that or not not you're
0:50
going next semester to have one okay so these are the three branches of classical mechanics essentially physics
0:59
up to the last century one century so
1:06
what now electrodynamics is is a very broad subject and no way that in 20
1:14
lectures I'm going to cover I mean we are just going to cover a very limited
1:21
amount of of what we could do but the idea is to introduce to you the main
1:29
equations so that you are going to be able to read a book or papers on the
1:37
subject and of course to build on that for your further studies in physics
1:42
maybe it's a good point here - how much do you know about did you know the Maxwell's equations how many of you can
1:51
you also so who knows the Maxwell equation raise a hand so don't be shy
2:01
principal all of you should know this stuff right because you have a degree in physics so I mean but okay so we are
2:08
going to end of course one has the problem where to start because this is a big subject so where should we start
2:15
usually well there are two ways want to start
2:21
from building up the equations roughly following the historical development so
2:26
starting from Coulomb and electrostatics and then these people with the with the
2:34
Umbra I mean did you know this stuff with magnetic forces but I think we don't have time for that I mean we are
2:41
too old for that so I rather start from Maxwell equation so I'm going to write
2:48
the Maxwell equations I'm not going to justify justify these equations you just
2:53
take them for for good the same way that we took Newton's law right we didn't
2:59
justify why F equal MA just take that for good right that is true and then let's see what we can do
3:07
with that so my idea here is just let's do the same with Maxwell's equations and
3:12
then derive from those all the possible consequences among which you will
3:19
rediscover Coulomb's law right this idea that two charges attract or repel each
3:26
other with the force that inversely proportional to the distance just exactly like Newton's law of universal
3:33
gravity so maybe I write like I did for for for classical mechanics a short
3:39
outline you know what we are going hopefully out to do so I think before
3:47
Maxwell equations I write today in fact I would like to say a few words about
3:52
Lorentz force because remember that
4:01
electrodynamics is the Maxwell equations plus the Lorentz force because the Maxwell equations tell you how to
4:11
compute the electromagnetic fields but they do not tell you how a charge moves
4:17
under the effect of this field right so you need an additional law a force that
4:25
is Lorentz force ok so we start from there by the way that was in your final
4:30
samso that's a nice place where you stop maybe you didn't notice but the problem there it was exactly the problem of a
4:37
charge in an electric a magnetic field we will do that in a second
4:44
so then Maxwell Maxwell equations of
4:50
course then from Maxwell equations we specify a subset of problems that go
4:59
under the name of a electro static
5:05
electrostatics so when nothing is changing with time and of course also
5:12
magneto static so usually in many
5:19
textbooks the outdoor start from here and build up to the Maxwell equation so
5:25
we go the other way I think it's faster and after all we know the answer so and Faraday Faraday's
5:34
law that is a sort of a bridge between electrostatic and magnetic statics so
5:41
here you start very slowly some electric field and discover that you have a
5:48
magnetic field because this is the very nice things that we discover either by
5:54
starting from the Maxwell equation or building this way is that the electric field and the magnetic field that
6:00
apparently are very different right I mean for many years people never dreamed
6:07
of thinking that the electric field and the magnetic field where this one and
6:13
the same things right why within the context of Maxwell equations this is
6:18
very much so because you see that by varying a magnetic field or by varying electric field you generate the other
6:25
kind of field and then it becomes absolutely fundamental when we rewrite
6:31
all the things in within the relativistic approach right from the point of view of Einstein's theory of
6:38
relativity it is and it must be that electric magnet
6:44
fields are one and the same things because depending how you move with respect to an electric field you start
6:51
seeing a magnetic field and vice versa so they must be linked maybe something
6:59
about conservation laws they apply to feel as we have seen they apply for the
7:06
motion of point particles of rigid bodies so we will study a little bit about these conservation laws for fields
7:14
and then we start solving the Maxwell equations as we did for the Newton's law
7:21
and there are classes of solutions so here I just write some with
7:29
solutions that means we see
7:36
what and then radiating system because
7:46
here we we make the day the the
7:51
surprising result that if you move if
7:57
you accelerate a charge or if you move accelerating a charged system you start
8:03
emitting radiation okay and this radiation is light according to
8:11
different frequency so then we study this solution that are plane waves
8:16
so you see Maxwell brought to the together a electro let's say
8:24
electrostatic and manic to statics and then made the fundamental discovery that when you bring these two together also
8:31
light that apparently has nothing to do with the charges or whatever is just a
8:38
particular solution of the Maxwell equation so light itself is unify in
8:44
this picture this is really the most important unification of forces that we had in physics still it still stands
8:51
that electricity and magnetism are the same force and light is just
8:57
manifestation of these two forces together this still stands I mean it's
9:05
still true in fact it's still the only truly unified force that we know because
9:11
if you go to quantum level probably you have heard that also the weak forces is
9:17
unified with the electromagnetic forces but this is not the same level of
9:22
unification that you have here there they are similar but they are not really
9:28
unifying the same sense that really are the same force as it is here so after we
9:34
study a little bit about the plane wave solutions of the Maxwell equations we I
9:40
will they asked me to to give an introduction about relativity so we will
9:48
study the dynamics of relativistic
9:59
relativistic particles and field so I
10:10
assume that you already know this stuff right this these things about Einstein
10:16
right e equal MC square but we will do it in a more systematic way as I as you
10:25
may have guessed and by how you do that in a more systematic way by introducing
10:30
space-time and by describing all physical quantities in term of four vectors right as we use vectors in
10:38
classical mechanics a to describe particles and now if you want to do it
10:44
relativistically you just move up one dimensions you you three time the same way you treat well almost the same way
10:50
you treat the other three dimensions and by doing that you use four vectors or
10:55
four tensors in general so instead of counting one two three you count 0 1 2 3 and by doing that you write all your
11:03
equation in a covariant manner it said so this is the the correct way of doing
11:08
relativity for at 4:04 for a student of physics and we do the
11:15
same for the field and if I have time I would like also to introduce the Lagrangian approach for fields that is
11:21
probably what you want to to have since you know how to write a Lagrangian for a particle and here we have feels it seems
11:28
reasonable to have the same formalism that is Lagrange equation and Hamiltonians also for the field so we'll
11:35
do that in four four dimensional notation okay and by doing that we will
11:41
rewrite much the equations in in a explicitly covariant manner it said so
11:47
that we are sure that they are relatively strictly covariant okay after
11:53
all Einstein himself started from here because he noticed that Y remember that
12:00
our Newton equations was invariant right you remember for Galilean
12:06
transformations that is the physics look the same for systems moving with with
12:14
constant speed one with respect to the others right you remember this was a very fundamental law which we built
12:22
before Christmas if you try this this is not true for Maxwell's equations so this
12:29
was the basic observation you had two sets of equations Newton's Maxwell's and Iceland check and
12:37
Mac well not just an exam everybody knew that Maxwell equations were not
12:43
satisfying the same principle of even Callaway and invariance that Newton's law did okay so this was a very puzzle
12:51
right you had two nice sets of equations describing all the physics you knew but they were not the same because some were
13:00
described from one invariance principle and the other so which one had to one of
13:06
the two had to is like now people talks all the time while quantum mechanics and gravity right probably you heard about
13:12
that you have quantum mechanics that works very well and gravity the design
13:18
staff theory of gravity that works very well but you don't know how to put them together okay so this was exactly the
13:23
same problem conceptually you have the Maxwell equation describing perfectly well all we knew about electrodynamics and the
13:31
Newton's law or Lagrangian equations whatever you prefer described in very
13:36
well classical system of particle strings and rigid bodies over this guy
13:41
but they look different they you could not put them together okay so something
13:47
had to to yield I mean which one is right okay here's the same question with
13:52
quantum mechanics and gravity is quantum mechanics correct all the way then gravity has to be modified or vice versa
13:59
quantum mechanics at certain tiny level of very small distances it has to be
14:07
modified to give rise to gravity okay well nobody's knows maybe one of you
14:13
will provide the answer but and here
14:19
probably most people put their money or Newton's because I mean that we knew
14:24
that women have equal a me I mean how can be wrong but actually as you know
14:30
the other way around is the correct one that is a Maxwell equations that are
14:35
invariant under Lorentz transformation not Galilean transformations right are
14:42
the correct description of nature and Newton's law is not correct you have to change Newton's law okay so that we will
14:48
discuss a little bit about this theory of relativity about which again I assume
14:55
you already know but it's nice to study something that you already know because
15:01
you feel comforted in your knowledge so
15:07
we will do a little bit not much I mean that again it's a subject we will discuss a little bit about Lorentz
15:13
transformation and how you modify some of the classical equations to allow for
15:19
for relativity okay so maybe we say something about the paradoxes because of
15:25
course it's not so obvious that this is the correct transformation laws because
15:32
you know that there are things that don't do not seems obvious when four 20s that
15:39
affect the velocity of light is only the same no matter the the frame of
15:46
reference that you are using right that is completely against Galilean transformation because obviously if you
15:52
are on a car moving 100 kilometer per hours and you turn on your lights
15:59
according to the Galilean transformation light from your headlight should move to
16:05
the speed of light plus the hand and 100 kilometer per hour this is obvious and of course it's not true so one has to so
16:12
you have all those paradoxes coming from that about dilatation of time and length
16:20
so on so forth it is just that we are not used to since our life is in a regime in which the
16:29
speed of light is very much higher than all the speed we so we are not use our mind is not used to this kind of Lorentz
16:36
transformation is much more used to the Galilean transformation even though even though that two are not so obvious
16:43
because remember what we discussed many many times that if you push something you stop pushing most people will say
16:49
that if you stop pushing the object we stop right why we know I hope by now to
16:56
have hammer in your head these things that if you stop pushing the thing keep of moving this is the Galilean
17:02
invariance okay so even that or maybe I think it's it I really believe that it's
17:08
more revolutionary the Galilean concept that you know if you stop pushing the
17:14
things keep on moving that is f equal MA that you know it's more revolutionary
17:20
than the einstein's idea that you have to use Lorentz covariance because if you accept that then is a little step to go
17:27
to Lorentz covariance okay and so after
17:32
having done this I think we I don't know if you probably we won't have the time
17:38
but I would like to go back to the problem of the radiation by a moving
17:45
charge so that we do it in a four-dimensional
17:53
way that is the correct way of doing it okay of course many things are left out there
18:01
are many things well but you can find most of these in in the textbook that I
18:07
suggest that is Jackson Jackson
18:12
directions I think classical electro
18:20
dynamics so as I already told some of
18:26
you this this is the likely the gore Stein classical mechanics that I
18:31
suggested in the classical mechanics class this is sort of the textbook that
18:38
everywhere in the world is used I mean any student of physics though a list of
18:43
these two books the directions and the constants okay they might be lambda but
18:52
they also this is nice because it's the common knowledge yeah you can't read
18:58
what I what radiation by charge yeah
19:05
it's hard to charge yeah I guess so it's
19:16
a part of being a physicist to belong to this community at least there are these
19:22
three to two textbooks that every student have study and so this is a bit
19:29
complicated some of the chapters are a little advanced I think we are not going to discuss those chapters but all the
19:38
rest you you find it they're a more or less I will follow that that textbook
19:44
unfortunately the the problems the exercises of this book are very difficult so if you thought the gold
19:51
standard where difficult these are really difficult so I didn't know what
19:58
to do I mean they are interesting I think a little too difficult for us so
20:05
I think this time I'm not going to assign problems from the books each time I will write so I think I take the the
20:12
problem from these other books that you don't need to to know about and I will
20:17
write here the problems and then you solve it and then we solve them together as we did the other time okay okay we
20:28
try this is the first time that this class is given by me at least so we try and see how how it works okay questions
20:36
please how much I think 20 classes so
20:47
that means formally 40 hours but things here the hour is like 45 minutes
20:53
it's a relativistic effect right there already so we see let's see I think
21:00
roughly that 20 classes you don't need more I mean you don't need to know
21:06
everything about this I think you need to to to you know it's like classical mechanics we didn't cover all the
21:12
subjects am we really sort of served true but I hope at least you have some
21:21
ideas some fundamental ideas I hope III I taught you about those and here we do
21:31
the same did this way you you you have the tools to move on to to to more
21:37
advanced subjects but you will always come back I mean in your professional life you will see you will have to go
21:44
back to this book because you will meet things that we haven't started working on you have to
21:58
a little bit too epic a butterfly
22:03
Commission okay other questions please
22:11
louder because I'm a little yeah I think
22:18
if you I don't know did you like the way we did it for classical mechanics if you
22:23
like that we do the same that during the week I give you some problems then you
22:28
solve them and on Monday we solve them together if you did not like that I mean
22:34
it's nice I think but it's time-consuming so if I do the problems
22:40
it's faster because I read the solutions in the book but I think it's good for
22:46
you to try yourself so so let's try it this way
22:52
we will see so my idea is that again i give you the problems then next Monday for instance we start and you saw two or
23:00
three problems and then so two classes for for the theory but as I said last
23:06
time the problems are also the theory I mean it's not the physics is not that you
23:13
have the front that you know the former staff and then the problems masked much
23:19
of the form of stuff is really hidden in the problems right because I can write
23:26
them actual equations but until you solve those equations in some specific problem and you get the feeling you
23:33
don't know them actual equations ok so you must you see here is a very good
23:40
testing ground for this idea that you know a physical equations when you sort
23:45
us know the solutions without having to solve it ok you always have a write the harmonic
23:52
oscillator that I bore you for four months before Christmas but I hope now
23:57
when you see the harmonic oscillator equations you already see the solution
24:03
right I hope because for you these two things must go together when you see dot dot and then something
24:10
you already must see this sign going up and down okay and this is
24:15
the idea when you see the Maxwell equations you already see the solutions okay the waves for instance okay other
24:23
questions the difference know that there
24:36
is no difference it's just name I think electrodynamics is more I don't know
24:44
sexier than electromagnetic because this idea of dynamics right you have this
24:49
particles moving around but I don't know it's just me probably okay it's the same
24:58
thing electromagnetism and electrodynamics and I should stay below
25:10
this line right okay so as I said let's start with something that we are sort of
25:17
familiar with that is so Newton's law
25:25
right is this no questions about that I
25:31
guess and so then the step that now we move to to the next step is that we
25:38
decide what the force is up to now we have taken some strange system where F
25:44
was was either due to Springs or to gravity or some stuff like that
25:50
essentially was some microscopical forces now as we specify our force to be
25:58
what is called the Lorentz force that as you know is the charge of your particle
26:04
so now the particles this idea point particles is characterized not only by
26:10
by having a mass okay but also charge okay a new property of this point
26:18
particles so I skip all this discussion you know what is the charge how you
26:24
measure unit you know the coulomb this is very boring and you are going to forget every
26:30
time you have to check on your textbook about what the units are let's just take that the the fundamental object that we
26:40
are going to study is again the point particle if you wish then we will
26:46
generalize to distribution continuous distribution of charges like we did for
26:53
the rigid body that was a sort of a continual distribution of mass but so for now let's study the Lorentz force
26:59
for a point particles that is characterized by the mass simply because
27:05
it has a mass so here you have M times
27:10
the acceleration but also a charge that is the charge after all we didn't
27:18
discuss much what the mass is right this philosophical question what is the mass and here the same you just have the
27:25
charge charge M these are the two fundamental quantities that characterize
27:31
your think of an electron for instance if you if you like and Direction is just
27:37
a point particle is characterized by two
27:46
charges the the mass and the electric charge and then if you remember there is
27:53
a the electric field and then the magnetic field that is a little weird is
27:59
the weird guy in this equation because he comes with this vector prodigal acity
28:05
so this is what is called the electric
28:13
it is is the magnetic field
28:19
this is the velocity and of course there is this very annoying thing about the
28:26
units in electrodynamics because you have many system of units and this is
28:33
always the bane of many students because you have always to remember in which
28:39
units you are working on I'll come back to this but this equation is like this
28:45
in what is called the International System of Units right did you study in
28:57
this systems or the Gauss system or the CGS system that is like Gauss in this
29:04
case in that case if you are using Gauss or CSU you have an extra 1 over C where
29:11
C is the velocity of light from now on in your life for you C is always I don't
29:17
know really why they call it C but maybe because it's constant I know but anyway
29:23
C is all going to be don't be dead students today at the end of the class on relativity asked what is that really
29:33
kills you so see it appear C so they the
29:38
Gauss well I'll come back to these things about the unit's because it's it's complicated and it's really not
29:46
essential but so let's stick to this
29:53
International System of Units and so
29:59
there is no C there
30:05
so what can we say about these equations okay first of all notice that is you see the force is given not in terms of the
30:14
of the physical quantities directly but rather through one-step mediated by this
30:20
new concept of field right instead of telling you that this force is
30:27
proportional like in the Coulomb force right the product of charges I rather tell you that I tell you what these two
30:35
fields the values of these two fields anywhere in space okay and then if I've
30:42
given you these two fields vector fields notice then you know how to compute the
30:48
source okay this is the idea and this is a very ok it's the small step it looks
30:56
like a small step it's a little bit how we did it for the gravitational force
31:01
right we didn't study the gravitational force by telling you that if you have a
31:07
mass it attracts the other mass attracted it with a force that we introduced the potential that gives you
31:13
the value of the potential everywhere in space and then the force the gravitational force was the gradient of
31:20
the potential right so we use the potential not to describe the force so
31:25
you see it was like intermediate steps but it's very useful and here is really
31:31
the development of this idea to the nth powers because everywhere you specify
31:37
two fields the electric and the magnetic fields okay and once you know that you
31:43
know the force because you use Lorentz force so this is Lauren
31:50
and as I said this is a very you see this looks like a small step but really
31:57
is the beginning of modern physics because modern physics is made of filth
32:02
the idea is that everything in nature that is fundamental all forces are
32:10
really filled ok and I don't know if you appreciate the difference because before
32:18
you had forces that like for instant force the Coulomb force tells you that
32:24
if I have a charge here in the charge here they attract or repel each other with
32:30
the certain force that is proportional to the product of the charges and inversely proportional to the square of
32:36
the distance but you see this is a description in which you take two charges even infinitely distant and
32:43
instantaneously they act on each other producing this force right so this is
32:48
the idea also Newton's law of gravity is the same right you have the Sun there and Jupiter there instantaneously they
32:56
act on each other but here is a very different approach here I don't tell you
33:02
what happened very far away everything is local because this is the force at the point X and a time T and this is the
33:09
field at the same point and time and this is the field at the same point time everything is local
33:15
there is no instantaneous action ok or interaction everything happen locally
33:22
you know what the value of the field is here and you know what the force is there the same point ok so everything is
33:31
local this is really the mantra of modern physics there is no action at the distance everything happens because
33:37
nearby something is changing ok and therefore remember if this is the case
33:43
you can describe it using differential equations because differential equations tell you how sometimes it changes a
33:50
little bit away from where you know how its behavior and in fact the Maxwell
33:55
equations are going to be differential equations ok vector the Victorian differential equation but still
34:01
differential equation so this this idea of writing the force through
34:06
some fields and therefore describing everything locally it's very important
34:12
conceptually okay even before we start solving this equation because it allows us to
34:17
describe the all of physics locally everything happens because it happens in that point and not because of action at
34:25
the distance this is still important today okay it's still important today
34:30
and there is a nice book that you may like to the I stand himself is saying
34:37
together with the Infeld who was a colleague they wrote the start of a
34:42
history of physics that is called I think the evolution of the physical law you find it in the tag it's a very nice
34:48
very simple book that you can read and enjoy and essentially he describes how
34:54
at this idea of field develop and from from very specific example to dominating
35:04
the entire understanding of the physical world so that's a nice reading I
35:09
remember when I read it I was very impressed so let's let's study two
35:27
simple examples of how this motion so what is the motion of a charge and a
35:33
given electric and magnetic field of course the simplest example is if we take this field to be uniform and
35:40
constant okay so let's just stick to this very simple example you have a charge okay so with Q and a particle
35:50
coming in in a region in which there are
35:55
uniform and constant electric and magnetic fields how is it going to move okay so if particles come in in a region
36:04
in which for instance you know like the the CERN LHC is exactly this example you
36:12
you fire a proton that is a charged particle with the mass the mass of the proton and
36:17
any goes inside the tunnel where there is in fact magnetic and electric fields and they are made in such a way that the
36:24
particle is curved and it goes around right I natural the particle the proton
36:30
will go straight but because you have a magnetic field it will curve and because
36:35
you have an electric field it will accelerate so that's the basic idea of these big accelerators that people use
36:45
to explore the fundamental particles so what is so let's try this Lorentz force
36:55
for this pitch cific case let's start with let's first do it for the simplest
37:01
case and I guess the simplest case is well I mean if you see what what is
37:08
going on here the electric field right
37:14
it so we have a uniform and constant E
37:21
and B field so as I said the simplest
37:26
simplest case and maybe we can start
37:32
first with a constant and uniform B field what happened let's take a equal to zero
37:38
for the moment and what happened to the to the equation well you see it's very
37:43
simple because you have a D so you have this dot P so you have DT and V right
37:53
equal so you don't have this term so you just have Pam so I guess I put
38:04
well I like it to do it in the in the in the well well it's up to whatever Q so V
38:19
cross Q right and then you have the map
38:24
at the what B that is constant V cross V
38:32
so Q cross P and then here the mass I I
38:37
take it to be constant this is not strictly true if it's moving really fast but for the moment let's be non
38:44
relativistic so here I have the derivative of the velocity usual the mass I take it on the other side so I
38:52
have this quantity V cross say QB divided by m and then maybe you have a
38:58
see if you are using the Gauss units you don't have to see if you're using the
39:04
International unit okay well let's put so this is like this and this is usually
39:10
usually this is written in this form where you introduce you see this is like an angular velocities call where the
39:22
modules of this is this Q V MC this is
39:28
called the gyro main magnetic rotation it's a constant for that for this
39:35
equation okay because B is constant so I mean this this point it is really called
39:42
the gyromagnetic ratio because this is characteristic of the particle you see
39:47
once you give the charge at the mass of the particle that ratio is given and
39:52
then you compute by multiplying by B you you get the quantity so you see this
40:01
looks very much like the ya where we already have yes now the
40:19
electric field I put it equal to zero I do it step by step then we we turn it on
40:27
I just want to see how the solution looks when the electric field is zero notice yeah okay noticed one thing that
40:34
remember that the the the magnetic force does not do any work you see you
40:43
understand right because you see that the UCB is always orthogonal to the
40:50
direction so it's not producing so all the the work is done by the electric field
41:14
now I just actually and B are given there are external field so okay maybe
41:21
this is so yeah I'm study I mean the Lorentz force gives you the demotion of
41:29
the particle for given e and given B by a and B are external is not the electric
41:37
field a magnetic field generated by the charge these are two different problems but of course you are correct here I
41:43
should include also what happened because I am accelerating a particle so I'm generated but this will do it at the
41:50
end of these 20 classes because it's a complicated problem but here this is
41:56
like a point particle in a gravitational problem you don't compute the effect of
42:02
the mass of this particle on the gravitational field you assume that it's just an extend a gravitational field and
42:08
you study the motion this is why it's called a test particle right because you
42:13
don't compute the back reaction due to the presence of the particle in the
42:18
field this is a useful concept so this for us is a test particle that is I do
42:24
not compute the back reaction on the field sorry
42:30
due to the motion of this particle exactly as we don't compute the back
42:36
reaction in the gravitational problem due to the mass of the test particle that's why it's called a test particle
42:41
okay so again I'm taking e equal to 0 so I
42:48
have a sub problem that is simpler and you see that this is a so if I write the
42:54
component of this I take you see this is a vector product okay so I take the
43:01
let's take the B field in the Z direction okay and therefore you see
43:08
that you have the V dot X equal this Omega be the V Y okay and the V dot y -
43:20
oh me be the X because of this vector product
43:25
right and then in the Z direction where where they you have you see you have no
43:32
component so the V dot is equal to zero right if the B field is in the Z direction
43:40
here it gives zero for the Z so you have this in the other two direction the two
43:45
perpendicular directions you have this two component and they come with the opposite sign because of the rule of the
43:52
vector product so that's the equation
43:58
but this is rather simple if you want so this is trivial right but also this is
44:05
rather simple because you see that if you introduce the complex quantity VX
44:14
plus IV Y right you can bring this two equation these two equations in a single
44:21
equation because it's just the time derivative of this complex number must
44:27
be equal if you look - I write because
44:33
this and then this V X plus y Omega B
44:40
right so it's similar to what we did for the harmonic oscillator effect that this
44:47
is essentially a harmonic oscillator and
44:52
you already know exactly because it's like an our molecule oscillator the
44:57
solution of this is going to be that this quantity here is some constant let's call it a a to the I Omega T
45:16
right this is the harmonic oscillator and I solve it you remember how we did
45:22
it for the complex a nice way to solve their monocles letters is to introduce a
45:27
complex amplitude and this is the solution so it's an oscillating solution
45:33
and if I write it back into the real component so you see that the VX is the
45:40
real part of this number so you see that the solution is that VX is the sum
45:48
constant this 0 so it's the real part so it's the cosine of Omega BT plus some
45:56
initial phase right yvy is the imaginary part so if this visit not maybe could be
46:04
the minus because of the I it goes like the sine of Omega be this V not you can
46:12
check has to be the V X square plus well
46:18
if the square root of the x squared plus V Y square you remember this way of
46:27
solving the armonica later vaguely well
46:33
and because you have the velocity then is very I cannot just integrate right I
46:44
just integrate once we respect to the time and I get the trajectory so some
46:50
initial position plus some are the time so R is this V V naught divided by Omega
47:00
B right because I'm integrating so I have to to compensate for the Omega B
47:05
factor and then the cosine becomes sine because of the integration and similarly
47:15
I have for for my Y component now with
47:22
the cosine and as I said the Z component that is they said they
47:28
of T is just well zero acceleration so
47:35
if just some Z plus some V not T okay so
47:46
how does this trajectory looks like so you see it's very similar to the problem
47:53
you had in the final examinations right because you had the Lagrangian that gave
47:59
you equation of motion a part of which was in this form here
48:05
but you had also directly filled so we are going to do the food how does it so you see this party is telling you that
48:13
it's an Armani Casa later so is just moving in a circle right of radius R
48:23
with the angular velocity frequency
48:28
Omega B right so if this is the B field
48:34
this particle is moving like this but is also translating along the direction of
48:41
the be filled by a constant velocity okay so it's something like this is Alex
48:50
so it moves like this are the same time moves if there is a with this initial
48:57
velocity this clear so that's the
49:04
typical motion of a charged particle in a constant external magnetic field it
49:10
just moves with the in a closed orbit in the plane perpendicular to the B field
49:18
these orbits are called lambda orbits in quantum mechanics probably you have have
49:24
you studied this problem in quantum mechanics I'm sure yes possible that
49:30
this is a very important problem in quantum mechanics that you have dis orbits and the point is that in quantum
49:36
mechanics these orbits are quantized these are the Landau orbits of the motion of a part
49:41
next enemy field but here they are not wanted front eyes because it's Mexico
49:47
electrodynamics so essentially they move you see like this and if there is a
49:52
component in the direction of the B field then it translate with constant velocity in that direction okay
50:00
yes yes
50:16
now I think this is the initial velocity this is the initial velocity in the Z
50:24
direction so if the mother if it's not
50:34
moving it just moves like this so you
50:45
see it's a sort of trapping of your charged particle because if you put the magnetic field then the particle is
50:51
going to remain in this channel so you see the magnetic field is bending the
50:57
trajectory it's not doing any work it's just bending the trajectory or your particle and that's a way to contain the
51:04
particle right because by putting magnetic fields you keep on bending this particle and any stage within that
51:11
volume okay so what happened if I turn on the electric field also so we have to
51:20
let's solve so can I erase that
51:34
so we go on till 5:30 right or of I forgot it's for 5:30 right so let's take
51:53
the the so maybe let's solve it again in
51:59
the case so you have the the B field or something like this so now I turn on also the electric field I want to see
52:05
what is the complete solution so I keep so this is the z direction I keep the B
52:11
field in this direction okay then you
52:17
have a x and y direction something like this okay and I take my if field I take it in in
52:29
the zy plane something like this okay so that there is a component no like this
52:36
there is a component e in the Z direction and then there is a component
52:42
in the Y direction that is this one okay so the B field is here the other field
52:49
has a component that is perpendicular to the B field and then a component is Ed that is in the same direction as the B
52:57
field okay so I take my Duke to constant field in this configuration and
53:04
therefore if I look here so let's write now explicitly an x-acto and Y double
53:13
dot and MZ double dot okay so this part I have so I guess I said I said we use
53:23
go so I have this C so I have to do this in this direction you see the the field
53:32
is in the Z Y plane so there is no component in the X direction so for the
53:38
X is exactly as before I have Q over C B
53:43
that is the Bizet component but B is only in the Z component and the velocity y component of the
53:52
velocity so is exactly as before because there is no electric field there okay
53:57
now in the y direction you see now I have something slightly different because I do have a Y component in that
54:05
direction so I have as before my minus QC be X dot but I also have a component
54:13
coming from here that is just Q Y okay
54:22
so this part here is exactly what I wrote before I just wrote the velocity before because I wanted to to to get the
54:30
answer quickly but these are really in the Newton's equation in this case with
54:36
the acceleration how about Z double dot now before that was zero because there was no field in
54:42
that direction because B was in that direction but now you see I have a small
54:47
component what's more whatever component I have of the e field in the Z direction so here I
54:53
should put a Z component in that direction
55:03
so because of what we did before it's rather simple to solve the system you
55:09
see the change in the Z Direction is that before I had this uniform motion with constant speed but now I have an
55:16
acceleration because you see the acceleration is not equal to zero so the charge even in that direction is
55:22
accelerating because of the field in that direction that characteristic of the electric field that the actual field
55:30
is doing work is really accelerating the charge so if you want to accelerate a child you need an electric field if you
55:37
want just to deflect the charge you need the B field this is the secret of the
55:46
Lorentz force okay and if this the other two components are almost the same the
55:53
only difference is that you have this extra term that clearly is going to
55:58
produce a short of a drift in that because you see that I can rewrite this
56:03
equation as before so X dot dot is equal to the Omega B this Q be over MC y dot
56:15
so I have this two component that looks like the harmonic oscillator these two
56:22
but here I have a slight difference because I have this extra term that is
56:28
this one here I have Q over m times the
56:35
component of the and Zed is again Q over
56:40
m times n so the acceleration of a
56:46
charged particle is controlled by the value of the charge over the mass why they the rotation radii of the in the
56:58
magnetic field is controlled by this angular frequency Omega B okay and these
57:06
again are rather simple to integrate these are really if you look at this this is really what you had in your exam
57:13
I hope you recognize I just called this a and this B I guess not to confuse you
57:19
with the charges and so this is exactly the problem that you had there and so I
57:29
assume that you already solve it for your problem so I just write the solution here so this is trivia right
57:36
you have to integrate a uniformly accelerated charge so this goes like Q
57:42
is e divided by 2m t square plus whatever the initial velocity is plus
57:50
the initial position but the left a field initial position is somewhere here
57:55
at the origin you know that like one half GT square that you have in gravity
58:01
the only difference that here instead of having G you have this this quantity so
58:07
this is a charge is uniformly accelerating in that direction the other two are similar to before
58:14
so XT you have the harmonic oscillator solution right like the one I just
58:19
erased with a sine Omega T plus some initial phase and the YT that is just
58:27
the same stuff with the cosine of Omega t minus some constant I put it here just
58:35
to normalize but you have an extra piece here because of this that is the C II Y
58:45
V naught Omega T so this part here is this rotation going around as before but
58:54
at the same time you have a little shift in one of these due to this extra part due to the electric field in the
59:00
direction so the orbit is a little bit more complicated you have because of
59:10
this this term is called a drift right because you have a drift so it's not
59:16
very easy to describe this motion so
59:23
before it was just like this and then maybe moving as a Alex okay now even in
59:31
the even in the X so before in the XY plane it was just like this right then
59:39
if you had the component in the Z Direction this circle it was moving producing helix now even in the XY plane
59:47
you see it's not just the harmonic oscillator you have this shift so it's something like this right so you see you
59:56
have a drift so it would go like this but because of that term interest so it
1:00:02
doesn't come back here and that neatly it goes like this and then if you have
1:00:08
the say that this thing is sort of move up so you have to think of this and that
1:00:14
moving up in the Z direction okay can you see that or I have here in a
1:00:20
computer simulation of this orbit but well I don't know
1:00:27
you can try it's done with mathematic and so some of you like the program so
1:00:33
but okay so so if you put the Z component then you tilt this thing out
1:00:39
in the z direction and so it moves like this it comes out it is accelerating in
1:00:45
that direction okay questions
1:00:57
there this is the solution this is the
1:01:06
solution for that this is the orbit now the solution this is the full solution
1:01:15
not to get that yeah now this is the solution of this system the way to get
1:01:25
this is as you did in your problem or as you did not do that you you you see the
1:01:33
way to solve this but they are very this is trivial this you have to notice that
1:01:40
you know this is like you have the X dot you integrate this once and then you put
1:01:45
it back here and then you integrate that and you get this
1:01:57
okay so that's what I wanted to say
1:02:03
about the law and force we will come back to the Lorentz force further further on but in this remaining
1:02:11
half an hour I want to introduce the Maxwell equation so that I'll do it and
1:02:17
then we start so I see I mean the motion
1:02:32
is not very complicated you I mean yeah
1:02:52
in four dimension now this is three
1:02:59
dimension in two dimensions just the
1:03:07
Lorentz 14 so you want to solve the equations just in two dimension you can
1:03:14
do that everything in muscle be there right but I mean this is ah no ah that's
1:03:26
that's a nice question actually yeah now I understand yeah this thing exists
1:03:31
strictly only three dimensions right but there is another thing that you can have
1:03:37
in two dimensions but I'm not sure that we want to discuss that I this vector
1:03:42
product is actually as you said define only three dimension because you need in
1:03:49
two dimensions you have to introduce another things so okay now I see your
1:03:56
question but don't worry about that I mean this is artificial well it's not short efficient because many materials
1:04:02
are almost two dimensional right so it's interesting to study this in two dimensional systems but okay yeah
1:04:23
so if you wish three dimensions is there the smallest number of dimensions in which you can do this in a
1:04:29
straightforward way so that might be why we live in a three-dimensional world right so that we can have lurid forth in
1:04:38
this form this is a long-standing questions why there are four dimensions
1:04:44
instead of ten or have you ever
1:04:53
considered this problem clearly two dimensions are to two if not enough to
1:05:00
to to have organized life in a way right you really need three three dimensions
1:05:08
to have a brain because two dimension you understand I mean right so but from
1:05:14
the physical point of view of course the brain is not necessary so one may wonder
1:05:20
about lower dimensional worlds
1:05:27
okay so so we'll come back to the Lorentz force but only after we have
1:05:34
said something so the next question if you wish it here I have solid arrays
1:05:51
maybe a question you could have asked is why I don't use the Lagrangian right
1:05:57
since I I insisted so much about
1:06:05
Lagrange and so by effect true good questions that I asked myself effect we
1:06:10
are going to use the Lagrangian of course you can write this force this Newton's in terms of Lagrangian
1:06:16
equations the trick is that the easier in fact actually you cannot use E and B
1:06:22
you have to use some potentials so to do that I first have to develop some idea
1:06:27
about EMB introduce the potentials and once I have the potential I'm going to
1:06:33
write the lagrangian for the charge particle so if you ever have wondered so
1:06:38
it was not a waste of time to study the Lagrangian but of course everything has
1:06:43
to be recasted in in that language yes
1:06:56
the velocity is constant it's okay
1:07:13
then you just as long as if V is different from zero this is the force no
1:07:23
deep initially can be a constant but then you have to put that as initial
1:07:30
condition then you solve the equations and you see whether it remains constant or not right you cannot impose that you
1:07:41
say what you impose are the initial condition so you say okay I take a particle with constant velocity fine
1:07:47
then I plug in here no but you cannot tell the particles what to do after you
1:07:53
after the initial conditions because then that's the solution of the equation of the motion to be consistent then if
1:07:59
there is an electric field or something you will accelerate I mean you can turn
1:08:08
the thing around and say what what are the B and E field such that a particle
1:08:15
remains with yeah that's that you solve the equations then but in a way you
1:08:24
already know this because B is not going to change B it's going only to change the direction of V but not the ABS
1:08:31
because it's not doing any work so unless you have a e the the absolute
1:08:36
value of e remains constant you see B is not changing V B is only changing the
1:08:43
direction okay so now we concentrate on
1:08:52
these two quantities and try to say something where C goes and can depending
1:09:01
on the so back in the SI units so as I
1:09:07
said the discovery here is that the simplest way to write the floor and
1:09:14
force is not true telling the system where all the other charges are and how
1:09:21
they are moving but simply I assume that all these are the charges by moving or by simply being there
1:09:28
generate two quantities that I call the electric and the magnetic fields and then at that point by using this Lorentz
1:09:37
force I can compute the force acting on the test charge particles coming in into
1:09:44
the into the system okay so these two
1:09:50
are as I said are so these two are two vectors so there are field vector fields
1:09:59
okay in space-time we may as well start taking that is I have e for each point
1:10:08
let's use Cartesian coordinate XYZ and
1:10:13
also at the given time and be XYZ and T
1:10:19
so all the physics is controlled by these two vector fields if you know this vector field you know the force and so
1:10:27
you can solve your problem as we just did in the case of two uniform and
1:10:33
constant electric field okay so the one the problem now is how how I can compute
1:10:40
these two quantities by knowing
1:10:48
okay so if you know these two quantities you can compute the force effect you
1:10:55
don't care at this level of what exactly the distribution of charges and how they
1:11:01
are moving those charges that are produced in these fields if to distribution of charge is even different
1:11:07
from each other produce both of them produce the same electric and magnetic
1:11:13
field then you are going to have the same force okay independently so you have the couple these two problem and the other
1:11:21
important property is that you see you have a superposition principle okay this
1:11:28
will become clear when we studied Maxwell equations but if you have two distribution of charges and you know the
1:11:35
solution one and the other the solution when you have both of them is just the addition of these two fields so the
1:11:43
electromagnetic fields follow a superposition principle that is this
1:11:48
will come from the fact that the Maxwell equations are linear in the field okay
1:11:54
so there is no interaction between the field directly field to field okay this
1:12:02
is not always true you can think of many other systems in which you have that but
1:12:08
this is not true for the electromagnetic field and this was not true also for the Coulomb or for that matter also Newton's
1:12:15
law because remember that if you had the three-body problem for instant charge Q
1:12:23
in the field of charge 1 and Q 2 the Coulomb force on this charge is just the
1:12:28
sum of the force of this Plus this force of this right it's always a two-body problem exactly because like it was in
1:12:36
gravity because of the superposition principle if you had one solution if you have two system you just sum the two
1:12:42
solution the two forces and you have the distortion exist there are no peculiar
1:12:48
three-body effect there is no a piece that depends on Q 1 and Q 2 together okay but please
1:12:56
remember that this is not obvious it's a particular property of these fields you
1:13:01
can think of field in which the superposition principle is not true okay then you have
1:13:08
nonlinear effects on on your equation
1:13:13
for it for if the gravity is not exactly of this form because there are non-linearity in gravity and you have to
1:13:19
take that into account when you when you consider general the general theory of
1:13:24
relativity okay but for electromagnet is this is true it will be reflected in the linearity of
1:13:32
Maxwell equations and therefore if you have two distribution you can just summon them up in the field and the
1:13:38
force will be the sum of those of those effect so these are vector fields okay
1:13:49
by the way this is the reason why light does not interact with light exactly
1:13:55
because of this property if you have to deal more light and they shine across they just go across there is no we're
1:14:03
the interpreter for hands with light you cannot deflect light by using light
1:14:09
exactly like in Star Wars where they have laser swords this that clearly
1:14:16
nonsense because if you have two lasers they just they just go to across one
1:14:23
exactly no light does not interact with light because of the superposition
1:14:29
principle so if you have two beams two laser beams they just go across so if
1:14:35
you have a laser sword like in Star Wars they would just go across because there
1:14:41
is no interaction between these two so that's a neat trick but it's not true you need a nonlinear field if you want a
1:14:48
laser sword like what's-his-name take
1:14:56
the black guy Darth Vader so it cannot be light okay so this
1:15:03
principle so I hope this will fix that is important to remember that here you
1:15:09
have superposition principle so light does not interact with life exactly because light is made of electrum and
1:15:16
the field so these are vector fields so vector fields are stuff like this right
1:15:26
each point usually you draw a elect a vector field by drawing these force
1:15:34
lines are called I think Faraday was the first guy who start thinking of vector
1:15:39
fields in terms of force line meaning that for instance the field here you see
1:15:47
is the tangent to this line okay in each point so if you follow the
1:15:53
tangent you can draw a line and this is called the force line because in this case it gives you also the direction of
1:15:59
the force not in the case of the magnetic field though so that's a nice way of thinking if you have a vector
1:16:05
field think of this force lines fill in the entire room and that is the
1:16:11
configuration of the field this is a nice thing about the electrodynamics is
1:16:16
that it's very visual I mean you really have to produce these pictures and if
1:16:21
you understand these pictures you understand the Maxwell equations as I will show you in a second so if this is
1:16:29
the so another way you think of this is the velocity field right typical if you
1:16:36
have a fluid like water you describe the the fluid water by a velocity field that
1:16:43
is the velocity of water in each and each point in the fluid right so you have an him so this is like the stream
1:16:50
the current in the water described by the velocity at each point that is
1:16:55
tangent to this line so you see the river flowing and the river flowing
1:17:01
represent the the vector field of the velocity at velocity at each point in
1:17:07
the flow okay and here is the same the electric and magnetic field are flows of
1:17:12
these quantities in space okay so like underwater actually this is the way
1:17:20
Maxwell visualized most of these but you will see that is a very strange fluid
1:17:26
when we start writing the equations and you will see in a sec here's a strange fluid and in fact at
1:17:36
the end this idea because have you ever heard about the aether the thing that filled the entire
1:17:43
universe and people thought because light was was taught as waves of this
1:17:49
electromagnetic waves electromagnetic fields but you know that the wave to be
1:17:54
there need some substance a medium right if you have a like you hear me talking
1:18:02
because here in this room is compressed by my voice right so you have air and
1:18:09
the air is carrying the the sound waves and the same in the sea right but here if you had electromagnetic waves you
1:18:17
need something this something was called the aether because you need something to go up and down somewhere to carry the
1:18:23
wave I will come back to this because clearly there is no such thing because
1:18:29
light is carry across the back empty space so what is going up and down is
1:18:36
not clear at all okay but for the moment just think about these fields as
1:18:42
velocity fields so you have this room all filled with the fluid and you have this velocity fields going around and
1:18:48
you have two of those a and B okay now how you quantify this this is a nice
1:18:54
exercise in mathematics so it this is the picture now you need some mathematical tool to quantify for
1:19:02
instance when this line becomes very thick right or when they go around and
1:19:12
you know from your class on well I don't know you did some vector calculus right
1:19:20
so you know that these tools are are there and there are essentially so two
1:19:32
tools one that quantify the flux so how much of this stuff goes through a given
1:19:37
surface so you need to know what is the flux right so how much stuff so the idea here
1:19:46
so I'm not doing I'm not going to do did you do that in with the Narayan or the
1:19:55
divergence the curl yeah you did you did not you did oh you did not know but you
1:20:01
know what that is so I'm not going to do it mathematically I will do it
1:20:07
from the point of view physicist so the poor men mathematics so by then if you
1:20:14
if you I mean there is a rigorous way to introduce this and you are welcome to to
1:20:20
go to the text books but we don't have time and also probably I don't know I wouldn't know how to do it really
1:20:26
because the mathematicians but ok so I said the first thing you want to
1:20:31
quantify if you have this flux is how much of this stuff go goes across a
1:20:37
given surface so you have a given surface right and you have this stuff goes in true ok and you see that what
1:20:44
you need is the flux of this velocity field so this is the flux is the average
1:20:51
the average normal component right so if
1:20:56
you have a line here a line here line here you take the normal component to
1:21:02
this surface so you project out the component this is going to this the surfaces like this you project out the
1:21:09
normal component you take some sort of average normal component a multiplied by
1:21:18
how big the surface surface area so this is you know if the intuitive way idea of
1:21:26
the flux if you have water coming through you take a surface you compute
1:21:33
the normal component of the velocity going across that surface you multiplied by the surface area and this is the
1:21:40
amount of water that has gone through that is the flux right you agree so we
1:21:46
need the flux and then the circulation is called
1:21:53
that is the other quantity that I'm interest because I want to know if you
1:21:59
have here a lot of lines as I said or very few this is the flux high flux low
1:22:05
flag I also want to know how much of this stuff goes around doesn't go straight and for this the idea is that I
1:22:13
take a curve in space ok and then I take
1:22:18
the average of the tangential component
1:22:24
so if here I have this here I have this I take the tangential component of my
1:22:30
velocity field average tangent component
1:22:37
times the distance around so how big is this circle so with these two ideas flux
1:22:53
circulations we can write Maxwell equations because Maxwell equations are
1:22:58
telling you how much flux and how much circulation of the electric and magnetic
1:23:03
fields are linked together in a given situation ok
1:23:17
yeah did they or took the orthogonal the normal component now at this point let
1:23:29
me leave it at that then we do it properly now this is become even if it
1:23:35
is bigger it becomes rigor it's not by unit you understand here here I have an
1:23:43
integration over the surface when I go differential and here I have a line
1:23:48
integral along this right okay so we will get there but this is the intuitive
1:23:56
things so with just these two ideas let
1:24:03
me write a Maxwell equation so then next time we write a mathematical expression
1:24:08
for this but as I said the best way to to understand Maxwell equations is by
1:24:16
this picture so so here laws of electro
1:24:35
a key a Maxwell equation also known as
1:24:55
so the first one tells you something about the electric field if you already
1:25:02
know them you know it tells you that the flux of e through any closed surface
1:25:13
closed surface so if you take a surface for flux of a through any closed surface
1:25:25
is equal to who want to ya the net
1:25:36
charge inside the surface and actually
1:25:43
because of the units to divide by this quantity that is called the permittivity
1:25:49
of vacuum something like this but the first idea that so you take a closed
1:25:57
surface and the net flux of the electric lines is proportionate to the sum of all
1:26:03
the child the net charge so plus minus remember the charges contrary to the
1:26:09
mass come to in two varieties positive and negative charges net
1:26:26
closed so if you have a surface with no
1:26:34
charges inside you don't have any flux so we threw the dead this is completely
1:26:40
equivalent as we will see shortly to
1:26:46
Coulomb law it has to do in particularly with the one over R square dependence
1:26:52
another tab yes it means that say you
1:27:15
have lines like this but not originating inside then you take a cold surface then
1:27:22
they compensate so the flux that comes in is equal to the flux that goes out so
1:27:28
the sum is zero that's why is a quiver this is well that clear if you want the net flux to this
1:27:37
fear or whatever you need to put some challenges aside then you have lines
1:27:42
coming out this way right then you have a net flux through this closed surface
1:27:48
if the closed surface is not there an open surface if you use the language of
1:27:56
a fluid that means that you need a source of fluid in order to have a net flux through a cross surface right if
1:28:03
you take a sphere you put it in some in a river if there is no source of water inside
1:28:11
the sphere as much water comes in and goes out right so you have net flux
1:28:18
equal to zero this is the idea exactly so on wealthy we write this in
1:28:25
mathematical terms you can write it either in integral form or differential form but the idea is this I like you to
1:28:33
think always with this idea unless you have sources that is charges inside the
1:28:40
closed surface the net flux is zero it's very intuitive I mean either you produce something or if you do not producing
1:28:46
something inside like water like a faucet then the net flux is constant
1:28:53
because it's conserved if you wish right it comes in but then it also goes out so
1:28:59
this tells you something about the flux how about the circulation of e the other
1:29:07
quantity that we saw circulation will be around the curve C okay around C again
1:29:21
if you remember your Maxwell's you remember that this is equal minus the
1:29:27
time derivative of what of the flux of B
1:29:34
through s where s is the surface
1:29:41
included into the circulation C so you take a line C and this has a surface s
1:29:51
included inside the line C so the circulation of e around this curve is
1:29:59
equal to the time derivative of the flux of B through this surface right
1:30:10
so immediately you know that if you have a constant feel their constant be field
1:30:16
constant you see then the flux of this field is going to be constant and therefore the circulation of e will be
1:30:25
zero in fact in electro statics that is the next thing that we will do next week
1:30:33
where everything is frozen then the electric field is described by two
1:30:39
simple equation that the flux is proportional to the sum of the charges inside and the circulation vanishes okay
1:30:51
so you see it very simple is vice versa if you have it be field right then if
1:30:59
this B field is very or if the see the circuit is changing then you have a
1:31:08
circulation of e around that yes
1:31:26
the charges no this this is just a flux
1:31:32
of B across this surface s so if you have a very a B field that is vary with
1:31:38
time all the shape of the C is changing think of a electro electric motor how
1:31:47
does it work how does it work something has to move because you have to generate some electricity from a
1:31:54
magnetic field and from this equation you know that if everything is frozen I
1:31:59
mean if the magnetic field is constant then you get no electricity and no electricity no work so they are typical
1:32:07
you have a magnetic field that is constant but then you have something moving like a square or something or a
1:32:17
wire that turns like this because it's turning the the AC crossed by the B
1:32:24
field it's very and this variation induced the electric field that is the current across the loop this is the the
1:32:32
idea of an electric motor that that's what is moving everything in this room
1:32:37
everywhere right it is this simple equation is moving but Maxwell actually Faraday's before him understood that you
1:32:45
had sometimes it has to change because it's the derivative respect to the time that linked the B field at the electric
1:32:52
field you need something to change in order to induce the electric field and the force what is really doing work is
1:32:59
only direct electric field therefore you need this situation okay how about the
1:33:06
other then I stop let me just write the equivalent for the B field and then we we start so how about the flux of B
1:33:18
so the equivalent of this is flux of B right exactly the same through any
1:33:27
closed surface to any closed surface a
1:33:36
is equal zero
1:33:41
always zero that's great this is a beautiful property of the B
1:33:46
field and what is this property that there is no magnetic charge anyway or
1:33:51
better there is no magnetic monopole because you see this is the net charge
1:33:57
inside but here it's always zero so that means that you don't have the equivalent of the electric charge you don't have a
1:34:04
magnetic charge this is a people looked
1:34:10
very hard to look for this right this is this is a surface a closed surface is
1:34:18
always zero doesn't matter because it's always zero that means that you cannot have the equivalent of a chart because here to
1:34:25
make this different from zero I put the charge inside this surface and I generate the field right but Tia is
1:34:32
always zero I'm not telling you so that means there is no magnetic charge and
1:34:38
this is a big asymmetry in Maxwell equations you see these two are not the
1:34:44
same the B field is very different from the electric field because this B field has divergence all with zero as we will
1:34:51
see and this is reflected in the physical result that you don't have a
1:34:56
magnetic monopole and here you see already an example if you think that the
1:35:02
equations of physics must be beautiful must be symmetric always this clearly is
1:35:08
not true because here if you wanted that to be symmetrical and beautiful you would have put 0 in 2 or you have put
1:35:15
something here different from zero but that's not the way nature is one is zero the other is not give you the B field is
1:35:23
very similar station of the electric field but is different because it
1:35:28
natural there is no a magnetic or at least we haven't found one yet and you know that this is a there has
1:35:36
been a search for this magnetic monopole clearly they are not very common like electric charges but they haven't been
1:35:46
found so for the moment we stick to Maxwell equations and here we put zero okay you know that if you have a magnet
1:35:57
right and the monopole will be a magnet that is very thin and then you look just
1:36:03
at one end right because one end looks very much like the North Pole without
1:36:08
the South Pole if you wish but you know that then if you break that up you don't
1:36:14
you are not left with the North Pole you are left with the North and the South Pole this is exactly the thing no matter
1:36:20
how you cut your magnet you will always end up with the North and the South Pole
1:36:25
and so you get zero here anyway this is a sort of simple-minded idea but of
1:36:33
course at the beginning people thought that they were a magnetic objects and they thought maybe if you you cut it in
1:36:41
half I get the equivalent of a positive North Pole right but you cut then you
1:36:46
get always a North and South Pole so then eventually you realize that you don't have the Queen equivalent of a of
1:36:53
a single electric charge you don't have the a single electric magnetic charge to
1:37:00
the call a monopole okay but let me how about the circulation of be around see
1:37:10
actually here you have to put a C square for reasons of the units that we pick so
1:37:18
C squared times the circulation of be around C is equal to well there is a
1:37:24
term like this is equal to minus this part yes is symmetric so it is
1:37:33
proportionally to the variation in time of the slack so V through s where again
1:37:40
s is the surface spa by the circulation see
1:37:46
but again the symmetry is not so indeed is true that is when you vary a big
1:37:53
field you get a moove field if you vary a field you get the B field obeyed much
1:38:03
smaller because of the C square remember C is a pretty big number so actually
1:38:09
varying a field induces a B field but much less than very in a big field
1:38:14
induces an e field that's why electric motors are made using this equation and not that
1:38:21
equation but again the here there is a slight
1:38:26
asymmetry because you also have a piece that looks like this because it's the
1:38:32
flux of electric current through s
1:38:39
divided by this epsilon zero so here you have to add a new concept that is
1:38:45
electric current so you have charges but also charges that move making electric
1:38:54
current so if you have a flux a net flux of electric current through s okay this
1:39:03
flux gives you a circulation of B that is different from zero and these are the actual equations
1:39:20
so please be this is really all you need to remember after 20 lectures or
1:39:28
whatever them actual equations and in this form I think is very easy to remember so next time we we translate
1:39:37
this in mathematical expressions because we need those in order to crank the
1:39:44
handle and get the mathematical solutions and then we will move on to
1:39:49
specific problems like what happen if everything is static so we study electro
1:39:55
static magnetostatic then what happen if i'm very slowly they be filled and so on
1:40:00
and so forth okay questions okay so
1:40:07
maybe now is a good time for you to refresh your memory about vector
1:40:13
calculus because here we need to quantify this what is the circulation so you need to remind yourself what is to
1:40:20
do an integral of a vector along a line and what is to do integration of a
1:40:27
vector over a surface because that is the flux okay so that will give us Maxwell equation in the integral forms
1:40:34
then we will use did you do the the Gauss and Stokes theorem you remember
1:40:40
that so you did do not here okay so well
1:40:46
refresh yourself force about Gauss theorem and the Stokes theorem that remember you remember the link affect
1:40:54
the integrals along lined with integral over surfaces because that will allow us to to rewrite these equations that you
1:41:04
see are in an integral form because I do integrals over surface into a
1:41:09
differential forms that is easier to mean the integral forms are easier to
1:41:15
visualize like here but to work out the solutions is easier to use the
1:41:21
differential forms so we go and refresh yourself about these things so that we
1:41:27
go on speedily next time through the Maxwell equations choice
1:41:40
you
1:41:46
