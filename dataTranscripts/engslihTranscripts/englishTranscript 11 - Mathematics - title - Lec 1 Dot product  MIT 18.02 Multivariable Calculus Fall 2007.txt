0:22
So let's start right away with stuff that we will need to see before we can go on to more advanced things.
0:28
So, hopefully yesterday in recitation, you heard a bit about vectors. How many of you actually knew
0:34
about vectors before that? OK, that's the vast majority. If you are not one of those people, well,
0:42
hopefully you'll learn about vectors right now. I'm sorry that the learning curve will be a bit steeper for
0:48
the first week. But hopefully, you'll adjust fine. If you have trouble with
0:55
vectors, do go to your recitation instructor's office hours for extra practice if you feel the need to.
1:03
You will see it's pretty easy. So, just to remind you,
1:09
a vector is a quantity that has both a direction and a magnitude
1:18
of length.
1:33
So -- So, concretely the way you draw a vector is by some arrow, like that, OK?
1:40
And so, it has a length, and it's pointing in some direction. And, so, now,
1:45
the way that we compute things with vectors, typically, as we introduce a coordinate system.
1:53
So, if we are in the plane, x-y-axis, if we are in space, x-y-z axis. So, usually I will try to draw
2:00
my x-y-z axis consistently to look like this. And then, I can represent my vector in terms of its
2:07
components along the coordinate axis. So, that means when I have this row, I can ask,
2:13
how much does it go in the x direction? How much does it go in the y direction? How much does it go in the z direction?
2:20
And, so, let's call this a vector A.
2:25
So, it's more convention. When we have a vector quantity, we put an arrow on top to remind us that it's a vector.
2:32
If it's in the textbook, then sometimes it's in bold because it's easier to typeset. If you've tried in your
2:39
favorite word processor, bold is easy and vectors are
2:44
not easy. So, the vector you can try to decompose terms of unit vectors directed along the coordinate
2:56
axis. So, the convention is there is a vector that we call ***amp***lt;i***amp***gt;
3:03
hat that points along the x axis and has length one.
3:08
There's a vector called ***amp***lt;j***amp***gt; hat that does the same along the y axis, and the ***amp***lt;k***amp***gt;
3:14
hat that does the same along the z axis. And, so, we can express any vector in terms of its
3:20
components. So, the other notation is ***amp***lt;a1, a2, a3 ***amp***gt;
3:29
between these square brackets. Well, in angular brackets.
3:37
So, the length of a vector we denote by, if you want,
3:42
it's the same notation as the absolute value. So, that's going to be a number, as we say,
3:50
now, a scalar quantity. OK, so, a scalar quantity is a usual numerical quantity as opposed to a vector quantity.
3:58
And, its direction is sometimes called dir A,
4:08
and that can be obtained just by scaling the vector down to unit length, for example,
4:17
by dividing it by its length. So -- Well, there's a lot of
4:26
notation to be learned. So, for example,
4:32
if I have two points, P and Q, then I can draw a vector from P to Q. And, that vector is called
4:42
vector PQ, OK? So, maybe we'll call it A. But, a vector doesn't really have, necessarily,
4:48
a starting point and an ending point. OK, so if I decide to start here and I go by the same
4:54
distance in the same direction, this is also vector A. It's the same thing. So, a lot of vectors we'll draw
5:04
starting at the origin, but we don't have to. So, let's just check and see how things went in recitation.
5:19
So, let's say that I give you the vector ***amp***lt;3,2,1***amp***gt;. And so, what do you think about
5:34
the length of this vector? OK, I see an answer forming.
5:46
So, a lot of you are answering the same thing. Maybe it shouldn't spoil it for those who haven't given it yet.
5:54
OK, I think the overwhelming vote is in favor of answer
5:59
number two. I see some sixes, I don't know. That's a perfectly good answer, too, but hopefully in a few
6:06
minutes it won't be I don't know anymore. So, let's see. How do we find -- -- the length
6:17
of a vector three, two, one?
6:24
Well, so, this vector, A, it comes towards us along
6:30
the x axis by three units. It goes to the right along the
6:37
y axis by two units, and then it goes up by one unit
6:42
along the z axis. OK, so, it's pointing towards here. That's pretty hard to draw.
6:51
So, how do we get its length? Well, maybe we can start with something easier, the length of the vector in the
6:58
plane. So, observe that A is obtained from a vector, B, in the plane.
7:04
Say, B equals three (i) hat plus two (j) hat.
7:09
And then, we just have to, still, go up by one unit,
7:15
OK? So, let me try to draw a picture in this vertical plane that contains A and B.
7:20
If I draw it in the vertical plane, so, that's the Z axis, that's not any particular axis,
7:27
then my vector B will go here, and my vector A will go above
7:38
it. And here, that's one unit.
7:43
And, here I have a right angle. So, I can use the Pythagorean
7:49
theorem to find that length A^2 equals length B^2 plus one.
7:57
Now, we are reduced to finding the length of B. The length of B, we can again find using the
8:02
Pythagorean theorem in the XY plane because here we have the right angle. Here we have three units,
8:09
and here we have two units. OK, so, if you do the calculations, you will see that,
8:15
well, length of B is square root of (3^2 2^2), that's 13. So, the square root of 13 -- --
8:23
and length of A is square root of length B^2 plus one (square
8:32
it if you want) which is going to be square root of 13 plus one
8:41
is the square root of 14, hence, answer number two which
8:49
almost all of you gave. OK, so the general formula, if you follow it with it, in general if we have a vector
9:02
with components a1, a2, a3,
9:07
then the length of A is the square root of a1^2 plus a2^2
9:16
plus a3^2. OK, any questions about that?
9:23
Yes? Yes.
9:29
So, in general, we indeed can consider vectors in abstract spaces that have any number of coordinates.
9:36
And that you have more components. In this class, we'll mostly see vectors with two or three components because they are easier to draw,
9:44
and because a lot of the math that we'll see works exactly the same way whether you have three variables or a million
9:50
variables. If we had a factor with more components, then we would have a lot of trouble drawing it.
9:55
But we could still define its length in the same way, by summing the squares of the components.
10:01
So, I'm sorry to say that here, multi-variable, multi will mean mostly two or three.
10:07
But, be assured that it works just the same way if you have
10:13
10,000 variables. Just, calculations are longer.
10:20
OK, more questions? So, what else can we do with
10:28
vectors? Well, another thing that I'm sure you know how to do with vectors is to add them to scale
10:35
them. So, vector addition, so, if you have two vectors, A and B, then you can form,
10:48
their sum, A plus B. How do we do that? Well, first, I should tell you,
10:54
vectors, they have this double life. They are, at the same time, geometric objects that we can
10:59
draw like this in pictures, and there are also computational objects that we can represent by numbers.
11:06
So, every question about vectors will have two answers, one geometric, and one numerical.
11:11
OK, so let's start with the geometric. So, let's say that I have two vectors, A and B,
11:17
given to me. And, let's say that I thought of drawing them at the same place to start with.
11:24
Well, to take the sum, what I should do is actually move B so that it starts at the end of A, at the head of A.
11:33
OK, so this is, again, vector B. So, observe, this actually forms, now, a parallelogram,
11:41
right? So, this side is, again, vector A. And now, if we take the
11:48
diagonal of that parallelogram, this is what we call A plus B,
11:57
OK, so, the idea being that to move along A plus B, it's the same as to move first along A and then along B,
12:03
or, along B, then along A. A plus B equals B plus A.
12:09
OK, now, if we do it numerically, then all you do is you just add the first component of A with
12:19
the first component of B, the second with the second, and the third with the third. OK, say that A was
12:28
***amp***lt;a1, a2, a3***amp***gt; B was ***amp***lt;b1, b2, b3***amp***gt;,
12:35
then you just add this way. OK, so it's pretty
12:40
straightforward. So, for example, I said that my vector over there, its components are three,
12:48
two, one. But, I also wrote it as 3i 2j k.
12:54
What does that mean? OK, so I need to tell you first about multiplying by a scalar. So, this is about addition.
13:06
So, multiplication by a scalar, it's very easy. If you have a vector, A, then you can form a vector
13:15
2A just by making it go twice as far in the same direction.
13:20
Or, we can make half A more modestly. We can even make minus A, and so on.
13:31
So now, you see, if I do the calculation, 3i 2j k, well, what does it mean?
13:38
3i is just going to go along the x axis, but by distance of three instead of one. And then, 2j goes two units
13:47
along the y axis, and k goes up by one unit. Well, if you add these together, you will go from the
13:54
origin, then along the x axis, then parallel to the y axis, and then up. And, you will end up,
14:02
indeed, at the endpoint of a vector. OK, any questions at this point? Yes?
14:19
Exactly. To add vectors geometrically, you just put the head of the first vector and the tail of the
14:25
second vector in the same place. And then, it's head to tail
14:30
addition. Any other questions? Yes? That's correct.
14:41
If you subtract two vectors, that just means you add the opposite of a vector. So, for example, if I wanted to do A minus B, I would first go along A and
14:49
then along minus B, which would take me somewhere over there, OK? So, A minus B,
14:55
if you want, would go from here to here.
15:01
OK, so hopefully you've kind of seen that stuff either before in
15:08
your lives, or at least yesterday. So, I'm going to use that as an excuse to move quickly forward.
15:23
So, now we are going to learn a few more operations about
15:28
vectors. And, these operations will be useful to us when we start trying to do a bit of geometry.
15:34
So, of course, you've all done some geometry. But, we are going to see that geometry can be done using
15:40
vectors. And, in many ways, it's the right language for that, and in particular when we learn about functions we really will
15:47
want to use vectors more than, maybe, the other kind of geometry that you've seen before.
15:54
I mean, of course, it's just a language in a way. I mean, we are just reformulating things that you
15:59
have seen, you already know since childhood. But, you will see that notation somehow helps to make it more
16:07
straightforward. So, what is dot product? Well, dot product as a way of multiplying two vectors to get a
16:16
number, a scalar. And, well, let me start by giving you a definition in terms of components.
16:25
What we do, let's say that we have a vector, A, with components a1, a2, a3, vector B with
16:32
components b1, b2, b3. Well, we multiply the first components by the first
16:38
components, the second by the second, the third by the third. If you have N components, you keep going.
16:46
And, you sum all of these together. OK, and important: this is a scalar.
16:55
OK, you do not get a vector. You get a number. I know it sounds completely obvious from the definition
17:01
here, but in the middle of the action when you're going to do complicated problems,
17:07
it's sometimes easy to forget. So, that's the definition.
17:14
What is it good for? Why would we ever want to do that? That's kind of a strange
17:20
operation. So, probably to see what it's good for, I should first tell you what it is geometrically.
17:27
OK, so what does it do geometrically?
17:38
Well, what you do when you multiply two vectors in this way, I claim the answer is equal to
17:45
the length of A times the length of B times the cosine of the
17:51
angle between them. So, I have my vector, A,
17:59
and if I have my vector, B, and I have some angle between them, I multiply the length of A
18:06
times the length of B times the cosine of that angle. So, that looks like a very artificial operation.
18:13
I mean, why would want to do that complicated multiplication? Well, the basic answer is it tells us at the same time about
18:21
lengths and about angles. And, the extra bonus thing is that it's very easy to compute if you have components,
18:29
see, that formula is actually pretty easy. So, OK, maybe I should first tell you, how do we get this
18:39
from that? Because, you know, in math, one tries to justify everything to prove theorems.
18:44
So, if you want, that's the theorem. That's the first theorem in 18.02. So, how do we prove the theorem? How do we check that this is,
18:52
indeed, correct using this definition? So, in more common language, what does this geometric
19:06
definition mean? Well, the first thing it means,
19:11
before we multiply two vectors, let's start multiplying a vector with itself. That's probably easier.
19:17
So, if we multiply a vector, A, with itself, using this dot product, so, by the way, I should point out, we put this dot here.
19:24
That's why it's called dot product. So, what this tells us is we should get the same thing as
19:33
multiplying the length of A with itself, so, squared, times the cosine of the angle. But now, the cosine of an
19:43
angle, of zero, cosine of zero you all know is
19:49
one. OK, so that's going to be length A^2. Well, doesn't stand a chance of
19:56
being true? Well, let's see. If we do AdotA using this formula, we will get a1^2 a2^2
20:03
a3^2. That is, indeed, the square of the length. So, check.
20:14
That works. OK, now, what about two different vectors? Can we understand what this
20:23
says, and how it relates to that? So, let's say that I have two different vectors,
20:33
A and B, and I want to try to understand what's going on.
20:40
So, my claim is that we are going to be able to understand the relation between this and that in terms of the law of
20:49
cosines. So, the law of cosines is something that tells you about the length of the third side in
20:56
the triangle like this in terms of these two sides, and the angle here. OK, so the law of cosines,
21:07
which hopefully you have seen before, says that, so let me give a name to this side.
21:14
Let's call this side C, and as a vector,
21:19
C is A minus B. It's minus B plus A.
21:29
So, it's getting a bit cluttered here.
21:37
So, the law of cosines says that the length of the third
21:45
side in this triangle is equal to length A2 plus length B2.
21:53
Well, if I stopped here, that would be Pythagoras, but I don't have a right angle. So, I have a third term which
22:01
is twice length A, length B, cosine theta,
22:07
OK? Has everyone seen this formula sometime? I hear some yeah's.
22:13
I hear some no's. Well, it's a fact about, I mean, you probably haven't seen it with vectors,
22:19
but it's a fact about the side lengths in a triangle. And, well, let's say, if you haven't seen it before,
22:27
then this is going to be a proof of the law of cosines if
22:32
you believe this. Otherwise, it's the other way
22:39
around. So, let's try to see how this relates to what I'm saying about the dot product.
22:47
So, I've been saying that length C^2, that's the same
22:54
thing as CdotC, OK? That, we have checked. Now, CdotC, well,
23:01
C is A minus B. So, it's A minus B, dot product, A minus B.
23:09
Now, what do we want to do in a situation like that? Well, we want to expand this into a sum of four terms.
23:16
Are we allowed to do that? Well, we have this dot product that's a mysterious new operation.
23:22
We don't really know. Well, the answer is yes, we can do it. You can check from this
23:27
definition that it behaves in the usual way in terms of expanding, vectoring, and so on.
23:34
So, I can write that as AdotA minus AdotB minus BdotA plus
23:49
BdotB. So, AdotA is length A^2.
23:55
Let me jump ahead to the last term. BdotB is length B^2, and then these two terms,
24:01
well, they're the same. You can check from the definition that AdotB and BdotA are the same thing.
24:20
Well, you see that this term, I mean, this is the only difference between these two formulas for the length of C.
24:30
So, if you believe in the law of cosines, then it tells you that, yes, this a proof that AdotB equals length A length B
24:39
cosine theta. Or, vice versa, if you've never seen the law of cosines, you are willing to
24:45
believe this. Then, this is the proof of the law of cosines. So, the law of cosines,
24:53
or this interpretation, are equivalent to each other.
24:59
OK, any questions? Yes?
25:07
So, in the second one there isn't a cosine theta because I'm just expanding a dot product. OK, so I'm just writing C
25:16
equals A minus B, and then I'm expanding this algebraically. And then, I get to an answer
25:22
that has an A.B. So then, if I wanted to express that without a dot product, then I would have to introduce
25:27
a cosine. And, I would get the same as that, OK? So, yeah, if you want,
25:34
the next step to recall the law of cosines would be plug in this formula for AdotB. And then you would have a
25:43
cosine. OK, let's keep going.
25:58
OK, so what is this good for? Now that we have a definition,
26:03
we should figure out what we can do with it. So, what are the applications of dot product?
26:11
Well, will this discover new applications of dot product throughout the entire semester,but let me tell you at
26:17
least about those that are readily visible. So, one is to compute lengths and angles, especially angles.
26:33
So, let's do an example. Let's say that,
26:39
for example, I have in space, I have a point, P, which is at (1,0,0).
26:51
I have a point, Q, which is at (0,1,0). So, it's at distance one here, one here.
26:58
And, I have a third point, R at (0,0,2), so it's at height two. And, let's say that I'm
27:07
curious, and I'm wondering what is the angle here? So, here I have a triangle in space connect P,
27:15
Q, and R, and I'm wondering, what is this angle here? OK, so, of course, one solution is to build a
27:23
model and then go and measure the angle. But, we can do better than that. We can just find the angle
27:28
using dot product. So, how would we do that? Well, so, if we look at this formula, we see,
27:38
so, let's say that we want to find the angle here.
27:44
Well, let's look at the formula for PQdotPR.
27:50
Well, we said it should be length PQ times length PR times
27:56
the cosine of the angle, OK? Now, what do we know, and what do we not know?
28:01
Well, certainly at this point we don't know the cosine of the angle. That's what we would like to
28:06
find. The lengths, certainly we can compute. We know how to find these lengths. And, this dot product we know
28:14
how to compute because we have an easy formula here. OK, so we can compute everything else and then find
28:20
theta. So, I'll tell you what we will do is we will find theta -- -- in this way.
28:31
We'll take the dot product of PQ with PR, and then we'll divide by the lengths.
29:14
OK, so let's see. So, we said cosine theta is
29:27
PQdotPR over length PQ length PR.
29:33
So, let's try to figure out what this vector, PQ, well, to go from P to Q,
29:39
I should go minus one unit along the x direction plus one unit along the y direction. And, I'm not moving in the z
29:46
direction. So, to go from P to Q, I have to move by ***amp***lt;-1,1,0***amp***gt;.
29:54
To go from P to R, I go -1 along the x axis and 2 along the z axis. So, PR, I claim, is this.
30:04
OK, then, the lengths of these vectors, well,(-1)^2 (1)^2
30:12
(0)^2, square root, and then same thing with the
30:19
other one. OK, so, the denominator will become the square root of 2, and there's a square root of 5.
30:30
What about the numerator? Well, so, remember, to do the dot product, we multiply this by this,
30:37
and that by that, that by that. And, we add. Minus 1 times minus 1 makes 1
30:45
plus 1 times 0, that's 0. Zero times 2 is 0 again. So, we will get 1 over square
30:55
root of 10. That's the cosine of the angle. And, of course if we want the actual angle,
31:03
well, we have to take a calculator, find the inverse cosine, and you'll find it's about 71.5°.
31:12
Actually, we'll be using mostly radians, but for today,
31:18
that's certainly more speaking. OK, any questions about that?
31:26
No? OK, so in particular, I should point out one thing that's really neat about the
31:32
answer. I mean, we got this number. We don't really know what it means exactly because it mixes together the lengths and the angle.
31:39
But, one thing that's interesting here, it's the sign of the answer, the fact that we got a positive
31:45
number. So, if you think about it, the lengths are always positive. So, the sign of a dot product is the same as a sign of cosine
31:56
theta. So, in fact, the sign of AdotB is going to be positive if the angle is less
32:13
than 90°. So, that means geometrically, my two vectors are going more or less in the same direction.
32:21
They make an acute angle. It's going to be zero if the
32:27
angle is exactly 90°, OK, because that's when the
32:33
cosine will be zero. And, it will be negative if the
32:39
angle is more than 90°. So, that means they go, however, in opposite directions.
32:46
So, that's basically one way to think about what dot product measures. It measures how much the two
32:54
vectors are going along each other. OK, and that actually leads us to the next application.
33:02
So, let's see, did I have a number one there? Yes. So, if I had a number one,

I must have number two. The second application is to detect orthogonality. It's to figure out when two
33:16
things are perpendicular. OK, so orthogonality is just a complicated word from Greek to say things are perpendicular.
33:26
So, let's just take an example. Let's say I give you the
33:34
equation x 2y 3z = 0. OK, so that defines a certain
33:41
set of points in space, and what do you think the set
33:46
of solutions look like if I give you this equation?
33:52
So far I see one, two, three answers,
34:01
OK. So, I see various competing answers, but, yeah, I see a lot of people
34:11
voting for answer number four. I see also some I don't knows,
34:18
and some other things. But, the majority vote seems to be a plane. And, indeed that's the correct
34:26
answer. So, how do we see that it's a plane?
34:43
So, I should say, this is the equation of a
34:49
plane. So, there's many ways to see that, and I'm not going to give you all of them.
34:55
But, here's one way to think about it. So, let's think geometrically about how to express this
35:03
condition in terms of vectors. So, let's take the origin O,
35:09
by convention is the point (0,0,0). And, let's take a point, P, that will satisfy this
35:18
equation on it, so, at coordinates x, y, z. So, what does this condition
35:24
here mean? Well, it means the following thing. So, let's take the vector, OP.
35:32
OK, so vector OP, of course, has components x, y, z. Now, we can think of this as
35:40
actually a dot product between OP and a mysterious vector that won't remain mysterious for very long,
35:47
namely, the vector one, two, three. OK, so, this condition is the same as OP.A equals zero,
35:59
right? If I take the dot product OPdotA I get x times one plus y times two plus z times three.
36:09
But now, what does it mean that the dot product between OP and A is zero? Well, it means that OP and A
36:19
are perpendicular. OK, so I have this vector, A.
36:25
I'm not going to be able to draw it realistically. Let's say it goes this way. Then, a point,
36:32
P, solves this equation exactly when the vector from O to P is perpendicular to A. And, I claim that defines a
36:40
plane. For example, if it helps you to see it, take a vertical vector. What does it mean to be perpendicular to the vertical
36:47
vector? It means you are horizontal. It's the horizontal plane. Here, it's a plane that passes
36:56
through the origin and is perpendicular to this vector,
37:05
A. OK, so what we get is a plane
37:14
through the origin perpendicular to A.
37:25
And, in general, what you should remember is that two vectors have a dot product equal to zero if and
37:35
only if that's equivalent to the cosine of the angle between them
37:41
is zero. That means the angle is 90°.
37:46
That means A and B are perpendicular. So, we have a very fast way of checking whether two vectors are
37:57
perpendicular. So, one additional application I think we'll see actually tomorrow is to find the
38:05
components of a vector along a certain direction. So, I claim we can use this intuition I gave about dot
38:13
product telling us how much to vectors go in the same direction to actually give a precise meaning to the notion of
38:19
component for vector, not just along the x, y, or z axis, but along any direction in
38:27
space. So, I think I should probably stop here. But, I will see you tomorrow at
38:34
2:00 here, and we'll learn more about that and about cross products.
