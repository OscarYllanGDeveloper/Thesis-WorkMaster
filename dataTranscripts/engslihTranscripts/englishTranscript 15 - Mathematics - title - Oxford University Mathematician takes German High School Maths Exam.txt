hello math fans Dr Tom Crawford here at the University of Oxford and today I'm
0:05
sitting the German High School maths exam I have a feeling this may be the most difficult one that I've done yet
0:12
mainly because the actual exam paper is in German and I do not speak German I am
0:21
going to be relying on Google translate alongside the original equations and
0:26
figures from the German paper and I'm going to try and make sense of it all as well as obviously answering hopefully
0:33
the math questions correctly I will be sitting part A of the 2019 Arbiter
0:39
mathematics exam which is taken by students in Germany when they leave school around the age of 18. the
0:48
specific exam actually differs depending on the state this one comes from Bavaria
0:54
the region of Germany around Munich I have a maximum of 90 minutes to and
1:00
answer all of the questions I am not allowed a calculator and there is no formula booklet so I'm pretty much on my
1:07
own right let's get started question one lots of graphs
1:13
um so I can see from the translation obviously not the German version
1:19
um that it wants me first of all to determine the position and nature of the
1:25
extreme points of the graph of f where f is given by
1:31
the following function so we're saying that f of x is equal to
1:37
e to the 2x divided by X and I'm interested in stationary points so
1:44
that's going to be when the derivative is zero so let's calculate the derivative so F
1:49
Prime of x is let's write this as e to
1:54
the 2x times x to the minus 1. um so if we differentiate exponential
1:59
first I'm going to get a 2 e to the 2 x times x minus 1. I'm going to get a
2:06
minus x to the minus 2 times e to the two x and then I want to solve for that
2:13
being equal to zero derivative being zero gives you your stationary points
2:19
um so I can say F Prime of X is not when I can ignore the exponential
2:26
because exponentials are never zero so we can cancel that so it's when 2 over x
2:31
equals 1 over x squared so that tells me that 2x squared equals
2:37
x which tells me that X is not is one option
2:43
and then if I can now divide by that X or 2X equals one so x equals a half
2:52
okay now looking back at the question and my translation it does say the domain excludes zero
3:01
because of course when X is zero up here so I should have written X non-zero so
3:06
we can ignore that one so it's going to be when X is a half and it says the nature of the extreme point so
3:14
if we know that um can I think about what this is going to look like possibly
3:21
though it's probably going to want me to show it so I was thinking I could draw the graph and then argue why it's a Max
3:26
or I'm in uh but they probably want me to show why that's the case so I'm guessing second derivative so if I
3:32
calculate the second derivative I'm going to get F double Prime um is equal to
3:39
fun um four e to the two x x minus one minus
3:46
two e to the two x x minus 2.
3:51
the first time using the product rule and then for the next term I'm now going to get a minus so Plus
3:59
2 x to the minus three e to the two x
4:05
and then a minus 2 x to the minus 2 e 2 x
4:11
right again I know the exponential is non-zero
4:16
and always positive and I'm only interested in whether the second derivative is positive or negative for
4:22
Max or min uh so I can sort of ignore that
4:27
um so let's cross that off in a different color so I can kind of ignore the exponential which simplifies things a little
4:34
so I can say the F double Prime is e to the 2X and then the bracket I've got 4
4:40
over x minus 2 over x squared plus 2 over x cubed minus another two
4:49
over x squared as a minus 4 over x squared and I want this at x equals a
4:55
half F double Prime is equal to e times 4 divided by a half double so that's
5:03
eight minus 4 divided by a quarter so that's 16.
5:09
Plus 2 divided by 1 8 is 2 times 8 is 60.
5:16
so I think that's eight e doesn't actually matter because that is positive
5:21
so a positive second derivative is a minimum uh so this is a minimum
5:30
all right is that all I have to do for that one um
5:36
I think that might be okay awesome so I think that was one part one
5:41
part two I believe um having a lot of difficulty with this
5:47
uh language issue but anyway um okay so given it's the function right so
5:56
we have a new function I think a new function for part two which is f
6:01
of x is now given by one minus one over x squared
6:07
okay um and zeros tell me when the zeros are at
6:13
um minus one and two okay so zeros
6:20
at x equals minus one yeah and x equals
6:27
two do I agree with that I don't think it does have a zero and X
6:32
is two oh minus one and one good one translate okay
6:38
that makes sense yes I agree with that zero is an x minus one and one okay figure one shows the graph of f
6:46
which is symmetric about the y-axis I also agree with that furthermore the
6:51
straight line G with the equation y equals minus three is given
7:00
okay fine so I'm just going to draw this out for myself so we've basically got like a
7:09
um this okay this we've got something coming in and going through one
7:15
and then coming down here like so similar thing here it's symmetric coming
7:21
in through minus one sure this is X is minus one
7:27
X is plus one so this is X and this is y and then Y is minus three so let's say
7:33
that's down here so what is it wanting me to do then um
7:38
okay uh show that one of the points where G intersects the graph of f has
7:45
the x coordinate one half sure so I'm saying
7:51
um we want to solve minus three which is of course Y and we want when that is equal
7:59
to one minus 1 over x squared and then we just solve that algebraically I think and this is part A is to keep track
8:06
okay so minus three x squared equals x squared at minus one so I can take that
8:15
across and say uh plus so 4x squared is
8:20
therefore equal to one x squared is a quarter so that tells me that X is plus
8:27
or minus one half excellent I hope it asked me to find the second one
8:32
um it doesn't but anyway so definitely there when X is a half fine Part B
8:39
determine arithmetically the content of the area enclosed by the graph of f the
8:45
x-axis and this line right so you can use a different color
8:51
so we want this area so if I work out
8:57
one lot of it and then just multiply it by two that will give me the whole thing
9:03
um okay [Music] so and we have worked out this part
9:12
haven't we gotcha so this is when X is equal to a half
9:20
um so I've got a rectangle there right let's use another color
9:27
because I'm now going to say the rectangle area I can work out so the rectangle
9:36
area is equal to three multiplied by half basically is
9:43
three over two and then the sort of curved bit which I will shade in yellow here
9:50
so then that part is going to be a rotation so I think I'm going to do a rotation not a rotation thinking of forming a
9:58
volume of Revolution I'm going to do the integral between two points I think for that
10:04
so if I integrate negative of the function
10:10
to make it positive oh no I can just integrate between these
10:15
two points and remember that it's a positive answer okay let's do that instead
10:21
so I think the yellow area is equal to the integral of the function
10:27
so the function there is one minus 1 over x squared
10:32
DX and we're going from X is equal to a half to X is equal to one so I think
10:39
I believe that is going to be the answer that will come out negative I will then take the modulus of it and add it to the
10:45
rectangle that's the plan Okay so
10:51
let's do the integral so that's then X and it's minus x to the minus 2.
11:00
that's going to be to the minus one so I think it's x minus 1 over X so if I differentiate minus x to the minus one
11:08
bring the minus one down no so it's Plus X Plus 1 over X because if I
11:15
differentiate x to the minus 1 I get minus x to the minus two which is what I've got there okay so it's that between
11:22
one and a half so that is then
11:27
plugging in one that's then 2 minus the value at a half which is a half plus two
11:35
so it's two minus two and a half so it equals minus a half
11:40
so the total area therefore is a half it's the modulus of that so I think the yellow area is a half
11:48
so the total is a half plus three over two
11:55
um so let's say this now so I can say now the um so the positive part
12:02
to the right of that y-axis um has area two
12:08
and then we multiply by two because of the symmetry so I think the total area
12:16
is equal to four is my answer I think
12:23
question three I guess all right so far so good um figure two below shows the graph of a
12:30
function it does one of the following graphs here we go uh belongs to the
12:36
first derivative of f okay so let's just sketch out
12:41
f is going to help me here I think so it's going something like that it's going steeper there and it's going up
12:47
there and it's going like that right so what I'm going to do to start with here is just label where
12:52
the derivative is positive and negative I think that'll help me um so we've got a negative
12:58
negative negative and then it's obviously going to be zero and then it's positive right the way through
13:05
and then here it's positive and then here it's going to be zero
13:10
so looking at those graphs I need something that is positive at both ends
13:16
so that can be all of them great to pass through zero
13:23
oh it's actually giving me specific points here yikes okay
13:29
um so it looks like it's turning it two and minus two okay so I think this is minus
13:36
two this is plus two assuming these graphs are accurate they're usually not but it doesn't say not drawn accurately
13:43
so I'm gonna go with it so then I want it to go through zero at those two points basically so therefore
13:48
it could be one or three so that rules out number two because that doesn't go through zero and those
13:55
points um and does it appear to be getting steeper it does appear to be getting steeper but
14:02
what's the gradient at zero
14:08
um it's sort of getting
14:13
is it's definitely a negative gradient and it's at its steepest but would it be
14:19
oh is it going super negative or is it
14:25
pretty chill on the negativity oh Deary me okay so I have to explain
14:31
why I just read more of the questions says so I can say that it's it's definitely
14:36
not so I can say not to since
14:42
um derivative is zero at X approximately plus or minus
14:51
two which isn't true in number two now for the others it's to do with how
14:58
steep gradient is so looking at that it's it's less than
15:05
one the gradient is less than one and then so I can say it's also not three
15:13
since I believe the gradient between
15:18
plus or minus two is less than one it's yeah it's a
15:23
shallower gradient less than one so less than uh one with its modulus so
15:31
it's like I don't want to say that not less than one greater than minus one
15:36
is let's say greater than minus one let's go with that
15:42
um not quite as steep as what I'm trying to say it's a bit shallower but that means it's greater than minus one
15:49
greater than minus one so therefore our answer is one
15:55
is um what I'm going with okay uh oh that was just part a cool and
16:02
then Part B what's that asking me to do now um okay aha the I read The Germ one for a
16:09
second not very confused uh uh B the function f is an anti-derivative of our
16:15
original function so an integral okay give the monotonic behavior of f in the
16:21
interval uh one two three and justify it okay uh
16:27
so we want the integral of this so let's write that up here so integral
16:32
of this from
16:38
um one two three is the interval there okay
16:43
so um it's going through zero a little bit
16:49
past so three is about there one is about there
16:54
so what's happening to the function so
17:00
um what I'm going to assume is the graph in front of me is now a derivative okay
17:07
so let's think about what's happening to this function um so it's going between one let's put
17:14
that as two and let's put that as three and now what do I know about its derivative so its derivative is always
17:21
negative okay so um derivative
17:29
of f is negative on the Range
17:35
one three so it's always negative so it has to be that negative slope
17:42
now it's most negative near to two I think yes it's most negative so most
17:51
negative near X is approximately two
17:57
so what's that's going to say here is its steepest
18:03
its steepest near that point
18:08
most negative and then it gets less negative sort of
18:13
thing here but it's like it's got to stay it's Gotta always stay
18:19
negative it's steeper there and then it kind of tails off so it's
18:25
flat steeper flat
18:31
I think it's something like that um give them monotonic behavior of f ah so
18:37
we didn't want me to draw it so F decreases I.E
18:43
F decreases monotonically because its gradient is always negative
18:49
yeah yeah yeah I'm happy with that F decreases monotonically
18:55
on on three I think it looks something like my sketch but the question didn't ask me
19:02
that I just assumed it did incorrectly and did lots of extra work I think it just decreases monotonically I'm going
19:10
with that right and that is the end of three that is the end of three let's try question four
19:15
a set of functions h k where K is real and plus or complicate very good job
19:23
I've got this translation question four so
19:30
we have a a set of functions h k
19:36
where K belongs to the positive reals
19:42
okay differ only in their respective domains
19:47
uh they're expected differentiable their respective domains Decay differentiate
19:54
I'm going to assume this means the domain over which they are differentiable
19:59
um I knew I was going to run into issues with this this crude translation
20:05
I'm going to take it to mean uh differ
20:11
on domain where
20:17
differentiable I'm calling that apparently DK
20:26
so and we're going to be given what they
20:32
are okay that helps um so HK Maps X so we're told HK Maps
20:37
the function X to COS of X okay great
20:43
and we're told with DK is naught to K
20:48
okay so just some positive real number sure
20:54
thing before shows the graph of the function H7 okay so EG
21:00
H7 uh defined on right not two seven that's what they've drawn good
21:06
um the largest possible value of K such that the associated function h k
21:12
is reversible okay so I'm assuming irreversible they
21:17
mean inverse um so we want to know where so we can say it's invertible
21:25
and by invertible I mean an inverse exists um whenever it's one to one
21:33
um whenever it is one to one so
21:39
that's going to mean if it's starting at zero which is going to be one that's
21:46
right yeah it's large possible value of K so it starts at zero and then as soon as I get to
21:51
the point three no not quite three the point pi
21:58
then we hit minus one and then it begins to come back and repeat so it has to be
22:03
minus one um there's one over that so uh which is
22:09
on not to Pi yeah okay Pi is a positive real number so
22:15
that's okay right I'm gonna go with that uh okay to all the graph of the inverse
22:21
function great uh of this uh for this value of K
22:29
okay in figure four paying people attention to the intersection of the graphs of the function and the inverse
22:36
so I'm going to draw an accurate sketch bloody L all right don't even have the square paper that
22:42
they've reminds me of uh my Feathering graphs I
22:47
did in the GCSE maximum bad times getting flashbacks okay
22:53
um so let's try and Draw Something vaguely accurate so if I have the following
23:01
we've got um something like this and then we've got this thing coming down and right so
23:06
it's COS of X so this is y I'm drawing y equals COS of x to start
23:12
and we're going across to Pi and we're going to have a pi by 2 in the middle
23:18
so I know that cos comes down and goes through it's a very bad effort because
23:23
but anyway and that's going to be at one and then down here we've got minus one
23:30
um which is going to be this point so I just need to take that and then just reflect it beautifully
23:35
okay so let's suppose that's an accurate drawing of the original function so this
23:42
is H pi now if I wanted to invert that
23:48
then for example so if I were to write that as H Pi inverse if you input
23:55
um Pi no h Pi inverse so that is defined
24:02
for values between minus one and one okay so to find
24:08
on minus one to one
24:13
and so it's basically it's like that isn't it so if I were to
24:20
draw this now it's like reflecting in the line Y
24:26
equals X when you take an inverse function I believe because you're basically swapping the rolls you've got like y equals a function of X and you're
24:32
trying to rearrange to get x equals a function of Y so you're flipping in reversing that Y and X Behavior
24:39
so I think what it's going to do then is
24:44
Pi by 2 is like yeah so it's only actually defined
24:50
um between here so let's call this one minus one and then one is going to be like here
24:57
so when I input one it's come from zero so it's so it has the value of zero at one
25:04
and then when I input minus one it has the value of pi for the inverse function so Pi is like
25:11
up here Okay so let's suppose this is accurate again we're going to pretend this is
25:17
accurate so now if I try and join these up what's going to
25:23
happen so as we go through one when we get to the point
25:29
zero has come from PI by 2. zero has come from PI by two so over here we're
25:35
like here it's like Pi by two and then
25:41
a little bit near one we're like
25:47
the value is still quite close to zero yeah so that means it's coming in like that doesn't it
25:53
okay so I think it's gonna look something like and then it kind of flips that way is
26:01
that what I think it looks like whoosh I think it's sort of lurking something
26:06
like that um
26:12
that is yeah because then if I were to draw that I think that's right because then if I
26:18
were to actually draw in the line for example if we had a y equals x line I'm going to go right through there
26:24
right so if this is the Y equals X line yeah
26:30
I stand by that it's not to scale but I think it is going to be flipped
26:35
like that I'm going with it um okay uh paying two attention to the intersection of the graphs of the
26:41
function and the inverse okay so they want to know when they intersect so they intersect when they're equal to
26:48
each other so this one is cos inverse so you could say
26:56
um I can say they intersect when
27:03
cos minus 1 of x equals COS of x
27:11
interesting so when x equals COS of COS
27:17
of X yikes
27:22
um so what does that mean
27:28
um when does x equal cause of COS of x
27:37
so let's think so like COS of Pi by 4 is like the whole root two over two thing
27:43
but then COS of root 2 over 2 is definitely not
27:49
Pi by four hmm
27:54
I don't know if I'm supposed to write down the point where they intersect um
28:01
I can sort of roughly see where it would be uh
28:06
maybe I'll just leave it at that you possibly could work that out but it seems right now I'm drawing a little bit
28:11
of a blank so I think I'm going to claim I've done a half decent job there so maybe I'll move
28:17
on uh so for B for B for B where are you
28:23
um okay Enter the term in uh to find an
28:30
invertible function J that satisfies the following condition
28:35
um the graph of J and the graph of the inverse function of J I have no point in common
28:43
okay this is I think the translation's okay so I have to come up with a function in r
28:52
so so J um I'm guessing maps are the real numbers to the real numbers
28:58
right so that's why the following condition the graph of J and the graph of the inverse have no point in common
29:04
oh could I do could I do could I do could I do
29:12
um so I immediately and I thought of this when I was doing
29:17
the Because and the arc cause thing just now I want to do like a like a log thing
29:24
right because if I had a log it kind of looks like this
29:31
and then I have an exponential yeah I think this is it because then if you do the e to the X it looks like that and
29:37
then you've got the line Y equals X between those two things okay so that's Y equals X
29:43
this is um going to be y equals Lin X
29:49
right there and then this is y equals e to the x and they do not intersect
29:57
because they look like that yeah okay so I think that would be my function so in vertical function J so if
30:04
I say J equals e to the x I'm going with that all right what's next I'm assuming
30:11
question what was that for five should be next um
30:16
analysis task group two these questions may only be worked on in connection with
30:23
the questions belonging to the same group of questions they'll translate in Part B of the exam
30:31
so I'm not doing Part B so oh they kind of look the same
30:41
does that mean wait wait wait wait wait wait so
30:49
very much looks the same ah
30:54
I should have read the instructions but you know they're in German I believe I'm only meant to do one
31:02
of the groups from analysis I I think because it's basically the same question
31:08
with a few little modifications so I don't know if it's a different syllabus or different schools do different parts
31:15
I honestly have no idea um it's the instructions are just not really there on the exam even once
31:23
translated um I'm sure somebody who has taken the German Arbiter mathematics exam will
31:29
very happily tell me in the comments what I'm actually supposed to do uh but
31:35
I think I might just have to um I'm pretty sure I'm not meant to do
31:41
the exact same question and the fact it's labeled analysis task group one
31:46
which is what I just did and now this one's labeled analysis task group two is suggesting to me that I'm just
31:53
supposed to do one of those um so I do know that the mark the total Mark should be out of 30. and I think
32:01
I've already done 20 marks so far have I have I done 20 marks so that was 10 another five yeah
32:09
so I've done four questions each with five marks okay so I think just shows you how well prepared I am
32:15
for this one I don't even know the instructions I think I'm not supposed to repeat
32:22
basically the same thing uh and I think this means I'm supposed to go on to the next section
32:27
so if I look at the next section below that is stochastic
32:36
this is why I remember this values too uh it's about the limit of my German
32:42
uh okay so stochastic task group uh two or task group one oh there's sorry
32:48
there's task group one and task group two group two has pictures so I'm possibly
32:55
tempted to go for two I think I'm gonna go for two I don't know if I'm allowed to switch between
33:01
task group one and two I honestly have no clue but two has pictures I like
33:06
pictures I'm gonna pick stochastic grouped two so and this is only five
33:12
marks so hopefully isn't too bad but we'll see I guess um oh no 10 marks
33:18
okay ten marks then five ten marks uh either way disgustic task group two is
33:24
what I'm gonna do um right uh so this is now stochastic um
33:32
question one let's see what we got
33:37
okay uh one a Wheel of Fortune consists of five
33:43
sectors of equal size um okay so each one is 72 degrees I'm just
33:48
going to write that down immediately just in case um one of them is able to not one is able to one and the other one is labeled
33:54
two and then the other two sectors are labeled nine okay
34:00
um so let's let's draw a picture uh so I'm going to assume they're equal in size one's labeled zero okay
34:08
um so let's attempt to draw like fifths this is going to go really wrong
34:13
not bad um so they're equal size yes so let's suppose that's zero that's a one one of
34:20
them's label two and then the others are labeled nine okay and they are equal size right so I'm going to assume that
34:27
means equal probability but we'll see um it's spun four times calculate the
34:33
probability of getting the numbers two zero one nine in the order given okay so
34:39
we want the probability of 2 um and followed by
34:46
zero and one and nine okay so they're all independent
34:54
events doesn't matter what you spun previously I'm going to assume equal probability so
35:00
by Independence I'm going to say by Independence
35:09
that is just the probability of a 2 multiplied by the probability of zero multiplied by the probability of a one
35:15
multiplied by the probability of a nine the order actually won't matter it turns
35:20
out um no so if I'm going to get two on the
35:26
first one that's one out of five multiplied by the probability of getting a zero that's one out of five
35:33
probably getting a one one out of five probability of getting a nine two out of five so that's gonna be
35:41
two divided by 25 squared 625
35:47
okay so that's my answer uh right to pop B that was a yes Part B
35:56
um The Wheel of Fortune is spun twice find the probability the sum of the
36:01
numbers obtained oh is at least 11. interesting so I want the probability
36:10
sum at least 11 so greater than or equal to 11.
36:16
from two spins okay so let's think about what spins can
36:22
we get that make it greater than or equal to 11. so what could we have um so that would be a nine followed by a
36:29
two we could have a nine followed by a nine they would both work
36:36
and then we could have a two followed by a nine or again a Nine and Nine where
36:42
the nines are in the other order okay so we have to get a nine and we have to
36:49
get a two um
36:54
so so so so so so so so so let's just do these individually okay
36:59
I could try and be clever and use like a probability getting a two or a nine and figure it out from there but these are
37:06
the four things that we can get because there's all the orders don't even need to do combinatorics so I'm going to keep it simple I think these are the four
37:12
things uh so they're probably getting a nine followed by a two um what's the probability of that
37:19
uh we're getting a 9 is two-fifths times one-fifth so that is two out of 25
37:26
probably getting two nines is four out of 25. probably getting two and then a nine is
37:32
two out of 25 and then nines but the other way around is 4 out of 25. okay
37:38
so I think that's going to give me 12 at 25.
37:45
uh does that feel right that probably feels right okay so I think the answer then is 12.25
37:54
um okay and then there's a part no that was question two okay
38:01
all right I hope that was right uh going with it um yeah stick with it okay it's a good
38:08
question to them um so a binomial distributed random variable
38:13
uh I actually given with the parameter value oh x with the parameter value is
38:19
given five equals it's a good translation again so what is it actually saying
38:26
n equals five okay so we have uh question two
38:31
so we're told that X belongs to binomial
38:38
and so you normally need n and p but I'm being told that n is 5. and I don't know what p is so p is going to be my
38:44
probability okay um the diagram in figure one is giving
38:50
me the probabilities of getting the other things right
38:57
sure complete the top five equals completely
39:04
what completely oh the value for getting five okay the five including the
39:09
probability in the diagram and determine the approximate probability that X is two
39:14
right so I think terrible translation I think and the formatting
39:20
I think I'm supposed to work out the probability that x equals five so uh what is
39:26
okay what is the probability that X is equal to five um and I have the values for the others
39:33
right so that's like 0.5 and 4 3 2 1.1 right
39:39
um so the problems that X is less than or equal to isn't it yes so on the diagram
39:45
probability is equal to five well that's just equal to one so on the diagram which I think it is
39:51
asking me to complete the diagram I think it's asking me to complete the diagram so the probability of X with
39:57
five is one so it's like it's a cumulative frequency diagram so
40:03
um it's just going to be full full column up to one all right I can hopefully that gets the point across
40:10
um and then it says the approximate probability that x equals to
40:18
um okay so I want to know the probability that x equals two
40:24
and from the diagram tells me the probability that X is less
40:31
than or equal to two because it's again cumulative hard said I would cumulative cumulative
40:39
I almost said cumulative no it's just Camila's cumulative cumulative
40:45
Camille is the table cumulative who knows that warmer you add them up probability of X is less than or equal
40:51
to two um so that's coming in at like 0.4
40:56
I don't know it was like 0.42 I'm going to call that 0.4 204343 0.43 and the probability that X
41:05
is less than or equal to one is approximately what's that one saying
41:10
that's about a 0.15 so therefore the probability that x equals 2 is the
41:18
probability of being less than or equal to 2 minus the fact that you could be zero or one
41:25
so minus probability X plus one so that's approximately
41:30
0.43 minus 0.15 so I reckon that is about 0.28
41:38
that's going to be my answer for that one uh and that's it for question two this is question three now
41:44
I like this I don't normally like probability but this is okay
41:49
uh so question three what are you saying uh you're telling me a tree diagram
41:57
liked my diagrams uh so we have a two diagram blah blah blah belongs to random
42:02
experiments Cassie independent events A and B determine the probability of event B
42:09
okay cool so what have we got
42:15
diagram looks weird I feel like maybe they're using different notation to what I'm used to but uh I think let's just give it a go
42:23
so you've got an A Bar so I'm gonna guess means not a
42:29
um so maybe don't write it like that okay so let's
42:37
go for this so it's an a bar or a so
42:42
this one has to be a third and this one has to be two-thirds so I'm given the two-thirds so it's obviously one minus that
42:49
um and then I'm told that then getting B
42:55
from here if you're a total that's right total
43:02
also interesting in this exam it's a vertical tree diagram but as you can see I'm drawing it horizontal so this is
43:09
like the let's say the standard way of doing it in the UK is the horizontal tree diagram so I'm going to stick with
43:14
that um so I think the total they're saying is 2
43:20
out of 15. right and I need to work out the probability
43:25
of getting B well I actually don't care about the others then do I so
43:31
so I could obviously add in these but I don't think this matters because I don't have enough information
43:36
but what I do know is I think well this is telling me anyway and they're independent events
43:44
independent events so I know that the probability of not a and then getting B
43:51
is 2 15 but that has to be equal the probability of not a times the
43:57
probability of B and I know the probability of not a is two-thirds so that's just two-thirds
44:02
times probability of B so therefore the probability of B is
44:08
just one fifth right two first times fifth sheet for Deeds yeah all right
44:14
cool I think that's the end of stochastics so it would appear the next
44:19
place to go to is geometry and again we've got task group one and
44:25
task now I know how it works um okay something about rectangles and
44:31
midpoints for um and something about balls or spheres
44:36
I'm gonna pick spheres over rectangles it looks like 3D coordinate geometry I
44:43
think if I've understood the notation which I may not have but hey what are you gonna do I can only make my best
44:49
possible guess given the uh the level of translation
44:54
quality uh it's gonna be geometry test two okay so spheres
45:00
um given by Center interesting notation
45:06
not sure what's going on here but let's write it out uh question
45:11
I'm going to assume this is a german-specific notation but I'm going to interpret this as best I can
45:18
so I think what it's telling me here best guess is that there's a sphere K1
45:27
which has Center uh one two three
45:33
so I think that's the XYZ coordinate they're using like a vertical line notation never seen that but I'm gonna
45:40
go with that and in minus three minus two one oh what was the radius radius
45:46
five okay radius five um R equals five and then we had K2
45:53
which was a second sphere and that has a center at
45:59
-3 minus two minus minus one plus one and also has R equals
46:06
five okay good show that to yourself
46:12
K1 and K2 cut show that yourself okay what a K2 cut
46:18
intersect show The Intercept I'm going with Chuck right show the intersect so
46:25
they will intersect s if distance between
46:32
centers is less
46:41
than sum of radii I think
46:48
so let me I'm gonna draw a little picture which obviously will be in 2D but the idea is to say there's like a center
46:54
here and then there's a center here so if we know the distance between the centers
47:00
and then this one's got like a radius and this one also has a radius
47:06
so it's like the two yeah if the distance between the centers is less
47:11
than they have to overlap I think I'm happy with that less than the sum up the radio so it's less than
47:18
10. okay so I want to show you the distance okay so I.E uh distance between these
47:27
two vectors so the distance between one two three
47:32
and minus three minus two one is less than
47:38
or equal to 10. okay so that distance is then the same
47:46
as figuring out um so the distance between two points
47:52
I remember how to do this you take the difference and then Square so it's 1 minus minus three
47:58
squared plus 2 minus minus two
48:03
squared plus three minus 1 squared and then the square root of that yes if
48:10
I Square both sides that's going to be less than or equal to 100. yes so that's equivalent to saying is
48:20
sets four squares that's 16 plus another 16
48:27
um plus two is less than or equal to 100 it's a lot
48:32
less um is that right it has to be right that has to be right
48:38
so this is true the intersect provided 34 is less than or equal to 100 which is
48:44
true therefore intersect okay
48:50
I'll buy that I'll buy that all right uh that was a
48:55
um to the cut figure so I guess I think again the intersection of K1 and K2 is a
49:01
circle term the coordinates of the center and the radius
49:07
of this circle wow okay Center and radius
49:14
of the intersecting Circle okay let's start with uh writing out information
49:21
that we have um okay okay okay okay
49:27
so I've got equations for these haven't I so I can say
49:32
x minus 1 squared plus y minus 2 squared
49:39
plus Z minus 3 squared has to equal the radius squared so has to equal
49:47
25 so that's K1 and then for K2 I've got x minus minus 3 so X plus 3 squared
49:55
y minus minus 2 so that's y plus 2 squared and Z minus 1 plus Z minus 1 squared and
50:05
that has to be 25. so the intersection
50:11
it's true that both equations must be satisfied
50:16
right so if I subtract these things off
50:22
let's try that um so if I subtract the equations
50:27
I think this will give me that plane of intersection hopefully so if I subtract the equations
50:33
okay what does that give me um so that tells me that x squared minus
50:40
2x plus 1 and then I'm going to subtract off the second one which is x squared plus six x
50:48
plus nine and then for the Y's I've got y squared minus 4X plus 4 and I'm going to
50:56
subtract off the Y squared y squared plus
51:03
4y plus 4 term and then for the Zeds I've got Z squared
51:09
minus six x plus nine and I'm going to subtract away
51:14
uh that one which is gonna be Z squared
51:20
minus 2X Plus 1. and it's equal to zero because they're
51:27
both 25 radius all right I think that's okay um
51:33
so let's do the X squareds go the Y squared let's go to Z squareds go which
51:38
is promising for my plane equation and I'm left with a minus 2x minus
51:44
another six so minus eight X 1 minus 9 minus eight
51:51
minus 4i minus another 4y so minus 8y
51:56
and then I've got plus 4 minus four so that vanishes and then I've got a it's not X that's Z
52:04
what am I writing uh minus six said Plus two so minus 4z
52:12
and I've got nine minus one so plus eight equals zero
52:18
right so I think the plane equation therefore taking all of those across is going to be eight lots of X Plus y plus
52:27
Z over two on that side has to equal zero ah
52:34
because they all cancel so
52:41
oh so I think plane of intersection
52:50
is therefore interesting and zero lies on it
52:56
so they're playing a midsection is through origin
53:02
helpful I think helpful maybe plain of intersection I believe is going
53:09
to be 2x plus 2y plus Z equals naught right
53:16
so now I know Z in terms of X and Y I think
53:21
I can just substitute that back into my equation I think I'm going to try it
53:29
so what can I say so therefore Z
53:36
is equal to minus two lots of X Plus y
53:42
and so if I put that into one of my equations uh let's take the second one
53:48
so Sub in and I'm going to get this is so not the
53:54
way to do this question um anyway I've gone down this route so I'm gonna have to expand this out I think
54:00
aren't I because it's not going to look like what I want it to look like oh okay oh I'm gonna have to don't make me do a
54:07
rotation anyway um x squared plus 6X plus 9 plus y squared plus four y
54:17
plus four and then plus Z minus 1 squared so
54:24
but I would have expanded that haven't I yes so now that's a plus Z squared which
54:30
is going to be 4 lots of X Plus y squared
54:39
that would be a z squared yup um Shaw minus two Z so that's then a plus
54:47
four lots of X Plus y
54:53
up and then a plus one and that's got to be twenty
55:00
five okay um so
55:05
I'm now gonna get a cross term on I oh I hate cross terms
55:14
um maybe this isn't the way to go about it this is tough
55:19
because that's going to give me a so this term here is going to be a four and then I'm going to have an x squared plus
55:25
a 2xy plus a y squared
55:30
all right and then 4X and 4y so I'm going to end up with a 5x squared
55:37
from there and there a five y squared
55:44
from there in there I've got a 6X plus another four plus a 10x okay
55:51
so that seems okay plus an 8y 8y
55:59
plus a 13 plus a 14.
56:04
from those three numbers but then I'm screwed over because I've got a plus 8 x y
56:12
and that has to be 25. so it's this equation
56:18
but that 8xy won't let me write it as a nice Circle
56:23
ER because I think I have to make a rotation what did the question ask for
56:30
the coordinates of the center and the radius ah it's very annoying
56:36
um okay Okay so
56:41
whilst past Tom is clearly having a hard time trying to solve this question let's head over to maplelearn to see how it
56:48
should be done you can access the maplelearn worksheet for yourself by clicking on the link in the video
56:53
description you'll not only see an alternative and let's be honest much quicker step-by-step solution but also a
57:01
neat visualization of the problem the two spheres are shown in red and blue and the plane of intersection which
57:09
fortunately passed on did calculate correctly is shown in yellow as we rotate the image we can see that in the
57:16
plane of intersection we do indeed have a circle following the steps of the calculation and making the most of the
57:23
computational power of maple learn we can obtain the coordinates for the center of the circle as minus 1 0 2 and
57:31
the radius which has a value of 4. to access the full version of maplelearn
57:37
you can sign up for a discounted subscription using the code in the video description now let's see how past Tom
57:44
is getting on in the means of fairness I think I will call this me being stuck
57:50
um how many marks is this three marks in total ouch so I potentially
57:55
may have lost some marks there but yeah no I don't know I'm I'm I am
58:02
drawing a blank as to how I'm going to find the the radius and the center of that Circle
58:09
um as I say I think I've got the plane of intersection but then it's I could try and project
58:15
the plane into the X Y plane oh but it wouldn't work quite like that
58:21
would it maybe there's probably some kind of rotation that I could do uh but I think for now at least
58:28
I'm gonna move on to uh what is it the last question I'm going to move on to
58:34
the very last question I think and maybe I'll come back to that with some new inspiration so I'll leave it as that
58:40
equation in The Orange Box which I think is right I'm not even sure if that's right
58:46
um but I will move on um I think because I am trying to sort of speed run these things let's be
58:51
honest here because obviously I should be able to do this uh clearly there's there's some circles spheres it's it's
58:58
Circle theorems again basically isn't it um all right well let's do
59:03
as I say let's finish with the last question then let's do question two
59:10
um in this geometry section I bloody hate geometry I used to teach it as well even or not
59:17
it's probably a good job I don't teach geometry anymore uh given my lack of knowledge of circles
59:22
and spheres um okay so what is this saying now the level I
59:27
think it means playing um given by uh what's that okay so part A we've got three x one
59:36
plus 2x2 plus 2x3
59:43
is equal to six okay contains a point whose three coordinates coincide
59:51
so I'm guessing that means X1 equals X2 equals X3 so I think
59:57
I think again this could well be Lost in Translation not sure but I think that's what it means
1:00:06
doesn't ask me to yeah determine these coordinates all right well let's try it so let's
1:00:11
call them all X so I'm saying that three X plus two X Plus another 2x is six
1:00:20
so that's telling me that 7x equals 6 so that's telling me that X is 6 7 so I
1:00:27
think they coincide when X1 equals X2 equals X3 equals 6
1:00:32
divided by seven that's more like it okay and then
1:00:38
Part B um what am I going to do now show that the following statement is
1:00:45
true there are infinitely many planes that do not contain a point whose three
1:00:53
coordinates are the same okay so I have to show this statement is
1:00:59
true if I have to prove prove question so I think I have to
1:01:05
prove infinitely many
1:01:10
planes infinitely so there exists infinitely
1:01:15
many planes that do not contain a point
1:01:23
that do not contain a point
1:01:33
his three coordinates are the same with three equal coordinates okay
1:01:40
so let's think about this so the equation for a plane so the
1:01:47
general plane equation
1:01:54
would be ax plus b y plus c z equals
1:02:01
some constant d so if uh
1:02:07
x equals y equals z that's equivalent to saying
1:02:13
I need a plus b i I think I can see how
1:02:18
I think I see how it's going to work a plus b plus c times x has to equal D so
1:02:24
that would mean in such a situation this would be x y and z
1:02:32
so if there was a point like this so then you can I see now so
1:02:40
therefore this fails so therefore there is no such
1:02:45
point whenever
1:02:52
a plus b plus C equals zero
1:02:57
so our coefficients there it's actually a normal to the plane ABC so when those
1:03:02
coefficients add together to be zero and there are infinitely many solutions so from that one and this has infinite
1:03:10
solutions because you can just fix a and then B
1:03:18
and C can be anything like you know a let's say a is zero then make B one and
1:03:24
C minus one B two c minus two etc etc it's there are very clearly infinitely
1:03:29
many solutions when you can pick a b and c um okay so I think that should prove
1:03:36
Part B which just leaves me with this intersection of two space question
1:03:43
bit of an anti-climax but I think I'm going to call it sorry everyone can't do it can't figure out
1:03:50
the uh the center and the radius of the intersection I've got I'm pretty
1:03:56
confident I've got the equation of the plane of intersection and I'm almost certain I just need to rotate and then
1:04:03
get a lovely new coordinate system where everything's going to work but my brain has turned to Mush apparently the
1:04:10
pressure of trying to do something timed and on camera and in exam conditions um so I I'm just going to call it there
1:04:18
um so yeah all right I got stumped I got stumped by that last question well played well played Arbiter well played
1:04:23
especially considering it was only worth how many marks was that meant to be three only three marks as well but I
1:04:31
guess it's three out of how many was the total out of 40 oh so I've potentially
1:04:36
lost like 10 of the marks ouch maybe that's why this exam is hard because there's not actually that many
1:04:44
marks available so when you lose marks they're going to affect your percentage but I'm confident
1:04:50
everything else I've done is okay I think I may have made the odd slip as
1:04:55
we've seen I I do make algebraic slips we all do we're all human part of being a mathematician
1:05:02
um but the rest of it I think was fine um in terms of difficulty compared to
1:05:08
other exams I've been doing definitely easier than the step paper as
1:05:13
it should be um I would say harder than the SAT the American exam
1:05:19
probably harder than GCSE maths as well even though it felt a little bit shorter because it had that calculus and graph
1:05:26
sketching inverse function and the proof at the end they're quite Advanced topics and they feel more like the kind of
1:05:33
thing you would see at a level in the UK so I'd probably put it sort of on par with like an a-level exam with some of
1:05:41
the questions particularly like the one-to-one mapping or that proof at the end possibly creeping into further maths
1:05:48
territory but Circle question
1:05:54
circles again anyway I really should revise of course Circle theorem Circle
1:06:00
equations anything to do with circles clearly I need to learn this um and I can't actually mark this I
1:06:07
should have told you all this at the beginning probably um I can't find a mark scheme for this online it says they're actually not
1:06:14
available and you should ask your teacher for a mark scheme on the website where I found this one
1:06:19
so I can't Market but I'm pretty confident that everything else I did was okay obviously I don't think I quite got
1:06:26
the answer they were looking for on the intersection of the Spheres maybe I'd pick up one mark of the three but I'm
1:06:32
confident that everything else I did felt okay felt right I think I'm sure
1:06:37
you'll all tell me in the comments if it wasn't um but and you're very welcome to do so please do
1:06:44
um but no it was it was good fun as always the uh the language thing was interesting with the uh the Google
1:06:50
Translate uh on the on the exam paper uh was certainly something that's a new one
1:06:56
um but yeah not quite perhaps the hardest as I mentioned at the beginning but somewhere somewhere in the middle so
1:07:03
