Intro
0:00
- This is a video about one of the most important,
0:02
yet least understood concepts in all of physics.
0:07
It governs everything from molecular collisions
0:09
to humongous storms.
0:12
From the beginning of the universe
0:14
through its entire evolution, to its inevitable end.
0:19
It may, in fact, determine the direction of time
0:22
and even be the reason that life exists.
0:25
To see the confusion around this topic,
0:27
you need to ask only one simple question.
0:31
What does the Earth get from the sun?
0:35
- What does the earth get from sun?
0:39
- Well, it's light rays?
0:41
- What do we get from the sun? - Heat.
0:43
- Warmth.
0:43
- Warmth, light.
0:45
- Vitamin D, we get vitamin D from-
0:47
- We do get vitamin D from the ultraviolet rays.
0:49
- Well, a lot of energy.
0:51
- What does the earth get from this, energy?
0:53
- Yeah, energy.
0:54
- Energy.
0:56
- Nailed it.
0:57
Every day, the earth gets a certain amount of energy
0:59
from the sun.
1:00
And then how much energy does the earth radiate back
1:04
into space relative to that amount
1:06
that it gets from the sun?
1:07
- Probably not as much, I, you know,
1:09
I don't believe it's just radiating right back.
1:12
- I'd say less.
1:14
- Less.
1:14
- Less. - I say less.
1:16
- I guess about 70%?
1:17
- It is a fraction.
1:18
- I'd say 20%.
1:19
- Because... - Because we use some of it.
1:22
- We use some of the energy. - Mm-hmm.
1:23
- We consume a lot, right?
1:24
- But the thing about energy is it never really goes away.
1:28
You can't really use it up.
1:30
- It would have to break even, wouldn't it?
1:32
Same amount, yeah.
1:33
- You know, cause and effect.
1:35
It'd be equal in some ways, right?
1:37
- For most of the earth's history,
1:39
it should be exactly the same amount of energy
1:41
in from the sun as earth radiates into space.
1:45
- Wow.
1:46
- Because if we didn't do that,
1:48
then the earth would get a lot hotter, that'd be a problem.
1:50
- That'd be a big problem.
1:51
- So, if that is the case...
1:53
- Yeah.
1:54
- Then what are we really getting from the sun?
1:57
- That's a good question.
1:58
- Hmm.
1:59
- It gives us a nice tan.
2:01
- It gives us a nice tan, I love it.
2:03
We're getting something special from the sun.
2:05
- I don't know, what do we get without the energy?
2:07
- But nobody talks about it.
2:09
To answer that, we have to go back to a discovery
2:12
made two centuries ago.
History
2:15
In the winter of 1813, France was being invaded
2:18
by the armies of Austria, Prussia, and Russia.
2:22
The son of one of Napoleon's generals
2:24
was Sadi Carnot, a 17-year-old student.
2:27
On December 29th, he writes a letter to Napoleon
2:30
to request to join in the fight.
2:32
Napoleon preoccupied in battle, never replies.
2:36
but Carnot gets his wish a few months later
2:39
when Paris is attacked.
2:41
The students defend a chateau just east of the city,
2:44
but there're no match for the advancing armies,
2:47
and Paris falls after only a day of fighting.
2:50
Forced to retreat, Carnot is devastated.
2:56
Seven years later, he goes to visit his father
2:59
who's fled to Prussia after Napoleon's downfall.
3:02
His father was not only a general, but also a physicist.
3:06
He wrote an essay on how energy
3:07
is most efficiently transferred in mechanical systems.
3:11
When his son comes to visit, they talk at length
3:14
about the big breakthrough of the time, steam engines.
3:18
Steam engines were already being used to power ships,
3:21
mine ore, and excavate ports.
3:24
And it was clear that the future industrial
3:26
and military might of nations
3:28
depended on having the best steam engines.
3:33
But French designs were falling behind
3:35
those of other countries like Britain.
3:37
So, Sadi Carnot took it upon himself to figure out why.
3:45
At the time, even the best steam engines
3:47
only converted around 3% of thermal energy
3:50
into useful mechanical work.
3:52
If he could improve on that, he could give France
3:55
a huge advantage and restore its place in the world.
3:59
So he spends the next three years studying heat engines,
4:03
and one of his key insights
4:05
involves how an ideal heat engine would work,
4:08
one with no friction and no losses to the environment.
4:12
It looks something like this.
Ideal Engine
4:16
Take two really big metal bars, one hot and one cold.
4:20
The engine consists of a chamber filled with air,
4:24
where heat can only flow in or out through the bottom.
4:28
Inside the chamber is a piston,
4:30
which is connected to a flywheel.
4:32
The air starts at a temperature just below that
4:35
of the hot bar.
4:36
So first, the hot bar is brought into contact
4:38
with the chamber.
4:39
The air inside expands with heat flowing into it
4:42
to maintain its temperature.
4:44
This pushes the piston up, turning the flywheel.
4:48
Next, the hot bar is removed,
4:50
but the air in the chamber continues to expand,
4:53
except now without heat entering, the temperature decreases.
4:57
In the ideal case,
4:58
until it is the temperature of the cold bar.
5:01
The cold bar is brought into contact with the chamber
5:04
and the flywheel pushes the piston down.
5:06
And as the air is compressed,
5:08
heat is transferred into the cold bar.
5:11
The cold bar is removed.
5:12
The flywheel compresses the gas further
5:15
increasing its temperature until it is just below that
5:17
of the hot bar.
5:19
Then the hot bar is connected again and the cycle repeats.
5:23
Through this process, heat from the hot bar is converted
5:26
into the energy of the flywheel.
5:30
And what's interesting to note about Carnot's ideal engine
5:33
is that it is completely reversible.
5:35
If you ran the engine in reverse,
5:38
first the air expands lowering the temperature,
5:41
then the chamber is brought into contact with the cold bar,
5:44
the air expands more, drawing in heat from the cold bar.
5:48
Next, the air is compressed, increasing its temperature.
5:52
The chamber is placed on top of the hot bar
5:54
and the energy of the flywheel is used to return the heat
5:58
back into the hot bar.
6:00
However many cycles were run in the forward direction,
6:03
you could run the same number in reverse, and at the end,
6:07
everything would return to its original state
6:10
with no additional input of energy required.
6:14
So by running an ideal engine, nothing really changes.
6:17
You can always undo what you did.
6:22
So what is the efficiency of this engine?
6:25
Since it's fully reversible,
6:26
you might expect the efficiency to be 100%,
6:30
but that is not the case.
6:32
Each cycle, the energy of the flywheel increases
6:35
by the amount of heat flowing
6:36
into the chamber from the hot bar,
6:38
minus the heat flowing out of the chamber at the cold bar.
6:42
So to calculate the efficiency, we divide this energy
6:46
by the heat input from the hot bar.
6:50
Now the heat in on the hot side is equal to the work done
6:53
by the gas on the piston,
6:55
and this will always be greater than the work done
6:58
by the piston on the gas on the cold side,
7:01
which equals the heat out.
7:03
And this is because on the hot side,
7:05
the hot gas exerts a greater pressure
7:07
on the piston than that same gas when cold.
7:11
To increase the efficiency of the engine,
7:13
you could increase the temperature of the hot side,
7:16
or decrease the temperature of the cold side, or both.
7:21
Lord Kelvin learns of Carnot's ideal heat engine
7:24
and realizes it could form the basis
7:27
for an absolute temperature scale.
7:30
Imagine that the gas is allowed to expand an extreme amount,
7:34
so much that it cools to the point
7:36
where all the gas particles effectively stop moving.
7:39
Then they would exert no pressure on the piston,
7:42
and it would take no work to compress it
7:44
on the cold side, so no heat would be lost.
7:48
This is the idea of absolute zero,
7:52
and it would make for a 100% efficient engine.
7:56
Using this absolute temperature scale, the Kelvin scale,
8:00
we can replace the amount of heat in and out
8:02
with the temperature of the hot and cold side respectively,
8:06
because they are directly proportional.
8:09
So we can express efficiency like this,
8:11
which we can rewrite like this.
8:15
What we have learned is that the efficiency
8:17
of an ideal heat engine doesn't depend on the materials
8:20
or the design of the engine,
8:21
but fundamentally on the temperatures
8:23
of the hot and cold sides.
8:26
To reach 100% efficiency, you'd need infinite temperature
8:29
on the hot side or absolute zero on the cold side,
8:32
both of which are impossible in practice.
8:35
So even with no friction or losses to the environment,
8:37
it's impossible to make a heat engine 100% efficient.
8:41
And that's because to return the piston
8:43
to its original position,
8:44
you need to dump heat into the cold bar.
8:47
So not all the energy stays in the flywheel.
8:51
Now, in Carnot's time, high pressure steam engines
8:54
could only reach temperatures up to 160 degrees Celsius.
8:57
So their theoretical maximum efficiency was 32%,
9:02
but their real efficiency was more like 3%.
9:05
That's because real engines experience friction,
9:08
dissipate heat to the environment,
9:10
and they don't transfer heat at constant temperatures.
9:13
So for just as much heat going in,
9:15
less energy ends up in the flywheel.
9:18
The rest is spread out over the walls of the cylinder,
9:21
the axle of the flywheel,
9:23
and is radiated out into the environment.
9:26
When energy spreads out like this,
9:29
it is impossible to get it back.
9:31
So this process is irreversible.
9:34
The total amount of energy didn't change,
9:37
but it became less usable.
9:39
Energy is most usable when it is concentrated
9:43
and less usable when it's spread out.
Entropy
9:48
Decades later, German physicist, Rudolf Clausius,
9:51
studies Carnot's engine, and he comes up with a way
9:54
to measure how spread out the energy is.
9:58
He calls this quantity, entropy.
10:02
When all the energy is concentrated in the hot bar,
10:05
that is low entropy,
10:07
but as the energy spreads to the surroundings,
10:10
the walls of the chamber and the axle
10:12
will entropy increases.
10:15
This means the same amount of energy is present,
10:17
but in this more dispersed form,
10:19
it is less available to do work.
10:23
In 1865, Clausius summarizes the first two laws
10:27
of thermodynamics like this.
10:29
First, the energy of the universe is constant.
10:33
And second, the entropy of the universe tends to a maximum.
10:38
In other words, energy spreads out over time.
10:44
The second law is core to so many phenomena in the world.
10:48
It's why hot things cool down and cool things heat up,
10:51
why gas expands to fill a container,
10:54
why you can't have a perpetual motion machine,
10:57
because the amount of usable energy in a closed system
11:00
is always decreasing.
Energy Spread
11:04
The most common way to describe entropy is as disorder,
11:08
which makes sense because it is associated with things
11:10
becoming more mixed, random, and less ordered.
11:14
But I think the best way to think about entropy
11:16
is as the tendency of energy to spread out.
11:19
So why does energy spread out over time?
11:22
I mean, most of the laws of physics
11:24
work exactly the same way forwards or backwards in time.
11:28
So how does this clear time dependence arise?
11:34
Well, let's consider two small metal bars,
11:36
one hot and one cold.
11:38
For this simple model,
11:40
we'll consider only eight atoms per bar.
11:43
Each atom vibrates according to the number
11:45
of energy packets it has.
11:46
The more packets, the more it vibrates.
11:49
So let's start with seven packets of energy
11:51
in the left bar and three in the right.
11:54
The number of energy packets in each bar
11:55
is what we'll call a state.
11:58
First, let's consider just the left bar.
12:01
It has seven energy packets,
12:02
which are free to move around the lattice.
12:05
This happens nonstop.
12:06
The energy packets hop randomly from atom to atom
12:09
giving different configurations of energy,
12:12
but the total energy stays the same the whole time.
12:16
Now, let's bring the cold bar back in
12:18
with only three packets and touch them together.
12:21
The energy packets can now hop around
12:22
between both bars creating different configurations.
12:26
Each unique configuration is equally likely.
12:30
So what happens if we take a snapshot at one instant in time
12:33
and see where all the energy packets are?
12:36
So stop, look at this.
12:39
Now there are nine energy packets in the left bar,
12:43
and only one in the right bar.
12:45
So heat has flowed from cold to hot.
12:49
Shouldn't that be impossible because it decreases entropy?
12:53
Well, this is where Ludwig Boltzmann
12:55
made an important insight.
12:57
Heat flowing from cold to hot is not impossible,
13:01
it's just improbable.
13:04
There are 91,520 configurations
13:07
with nine energy packets in the left bar,
13:10
but 627,264 with five energy packets in each bar.
13:16
That is the energy is more than six times
13:19
as likely to be evenly spread between the bars.
13:22
But if you add up all the possibilities,
13:24
you find there's still a 10.5% chance that the left bar
13:28
ends up with more energy packets than it started.
13:32
So, why don't we observe this happening around us?
13:36
Well, watch what happens as we increase the number of atoms
13:38
to 80 per bar and the energy packets to 100,
13:42
with 70 in the left bar and 30 in the right.
13:45
There is now only a 0.05% chance that the left solid
13:49
ends up hotter than it started.
13:52
And this trend continues as we keep scaling up the system.
13:55
In everyday solids, there are around 100 trillion,
13:59
trillion atoms and even more energy packets.
14:02
So heat flowing from cold to hot is just so unlikely
14:06
that it never happens.
14:10
Think of it like this Rubik's cube.
14:12
Right now, it is completely solved,
14:14
but I'm gonna close my eyes and make some turns at random.
14:18
If I keep doing this, it will get further and further
14:21
from being solved.
14:22
But how can I be confident that I'm really messing
14:26
this cube up?
14:27
Well, because there's only one way for it to be solved,
14:30
a few ways for it to be almost solved,
14:32
and quintillions of ways
14:34
for it to be almost entirely random.
14:36
Without thought and effort,
14:38
every turn moves the Rubik's cube
14:40
from a highly unlikely state that of it being solved
14:43
to a more likely state, a total mess.
Air Conditioning
14:50
So if the natural tendency of energy is to spread out
14:53
and for things to get messier,
14:55
then how is it possible to have something
14:57
like air conditioning where the cold interior of a house
15:01
gets cooler and the hot exterior gets hotter?
15:06
Energy is going from cold to hot,
15:08
decreasing the entropy of the house.
15:12
Well, this decrease in entropy is only possible
15:16
by increasing the entropy a greater amount somewhere else.
15:20
In this case, at a power plant,
15:21
the concentrated chemical energy and coal is being released,
15:26
heating up the power plant in its environment,
15:28
spreading to the turbine the electric generators,
15:31
heating the wires all the way to the house,
15:33
and producing waste heat in the fans and compressor.
15:37
Whatever decrease in entropy is achieved at the house
15:40
is more than paid for by an increase in entropy required
15:44
to make that happen.
15:47
But if total entropy is constantly increasing
15:50
and anything we do only accelerates that increase,
15:54
then how is there any structure left on earth?
15:58
How are there hot parts separate from cold parts?
16:01
How does life exist?
16:05
Well, if the earth were a closed system,
16:07
the energy would spread out completely,
16:09
meaning, all life would cease,
16:12
everything would decay and mix,
16:14
and eventually, reach the same temperature.
16:17
But luckily, earth is not a closed system,
16:21
because we have the sun.
16:28
What the sun really gives us is a steady stream
16:31
of low entropy that is concentrated bundled up energy.
16:35
The energy that we get from the sun is more useful
16:39
than the energy we give back.
16:41
It's more compact, it's more clumped together.
16:44
Plants capture this energy and use it to grow
16:46
and create sugars.
16:48
Then animals eat plants and use that energy
16:51
to maintain their bodies and move around.
16:54
Bigger animals get their energy
16:55
by eating smaller animals and so on.
16:58
And each step of the way,
17:00
the energy becomes more spread out.
17:03
- Okay, interesting.
17:04
- Yeah.
17:05
- Oh wow, I did not know that.
17:06
- There you go.
17:08
Ultimately, all the energy that reaches earth from the sun
17:11
is converted into thermal energy,
17:13
and then it's radiated back into space.
17:17
But in fact, it's the same amount.
17:19
I know this is a- - You do know this is...
17:21
- I'm a PhD physicist.
17:23
- Oh, okay, but anyway, so... - I trust you.
Life on Earth
17:27
The increase in entropy can be seen
17:29
in the relative number of photons arriving at
17:32
and leaving the earth.
17:34
For each photon received from the sun,
17:38
20 photons are emitted,
17:40
and everything that happens on earth,
17:42
plants growing, trees falling, herds stampeding,
17:46
hurricanes and tornadoes, people eating,
17:49
sleeping, and breathing.
17:51
All of it happens in the process of converting fewer,
17:55
higher energy photons
17:57
into 20 times as many lower energy photons.
18:01
Without a source of concentrated energy
18:03
and a way to discard the spread out energy,
18:06
life on earth would not be possible.
18:10
It has even been suggested that life itself
18:12
may be a consequence of the second law of thermodynamics.
18:16
If the universe tends toward maximum entropy,
18:19
then life offers a way to accelerate that natural tendency,
18:23
because life is spectacularly good
18:26
at converting low entropy into high entropy.
18:29
For example, the surface layer of seawater produces
18:32
between 30 to 680% more entropy when cyanobacteria
18:38
and other organic matter is present than when it's not.
18:42
Jeremy England takes this one step further.
18:45
He's proposed that if there is a constant stream
18:48
of clumped up energy, this could favor structures
18:51
that dissipate that energy.
18:53
And over time, this results
18:55
in better and better energy dissipators,
18:57
eventually resulting in life.
19:00
Or in his own words,
19:01
"You start with a random clump of atoms,
19:03
and if you shine light on it for long enough,
19:06
it should not be so surprising that you get a plant."
19:11
So life on earth survives on the low entropy from the sun,
19:15
but then where did the sun get its low entropy?
19:19
The answer is the universe.
19:22
If we know that the total entropy of the universe
19:25
is increasing with time, then it was lower entropy yesterday
19:29
and even lower entropy the day before that,
19:31
and so on, all the way back to the Big Bang.
The Past Hypothesis
19:37
So right after the Big Bang,
19:38
that is when the entropy was lowest.
19:41
This is known as the past hypothesis.
19:44
It doesn't explain why the entropy was low,
19:47
just that it must have been that way for the universe
19:49
to unfold as it has.
19:51
But the early universe was hot, dense,
19:54
and almost completely uniform.
19:56
I mean, everything was mixed and the temperature
19:59
was basically the same everywhere,
20:01
varying by at most 0.001%.
20:05
So how is this low entropy?
20:09
Well, the thing we've left out is gravity.
20:11
Gravity tends to clump matter together.
20:15
So taking gravity into account,
20:16
having matter all spread out like this,
20:19
would be an extremely unlikely state,
20:21
and that is why it's low entropy.
20:26
Over time, as the universe expanded and cooled,
20:29
matter started to clump together in more dense regions.
20:33
And in doing so, enormous amounts of potential energy
20:36
were turned into kinetic energy.
20:38
And this energy could also be used
20:41
like how water flowing downhill can power a turbine.
20:45
But as bits of matter started hitting each other,
20:48
some of their kinetic energy was converted into heat.
20:51
So the amount of useful energy decreased.
20:55
Thereby, increasing entropy.
20:58
Over time, the useful energy was used.
21:01
In doing so, stars, planets, galaxies, and life were formed,
21:06
increasing entropy all along.
21:09
The universe started with around 10
21:11
to the 88 Boltzmann constants worth of entropy.
21:15
Nowadays, all the stars in the observable universe
21:17
have about 9.5 times 10 to the 80.
21:20
The interstellar and intergalactic medium combined
21:23
have almost 10 times more,
21:25
but still only a fraction of the early universe.
21:29
A lot more is contained in neutrinos
21:31
and in photons of the cosmic microwave background.
21:36
In 1972, Jacob Bekenstein proposed
21:39
another source of entropy, black holes.
Hawking Radiation
21:46
He suggested that the entropy of a black hole
21:48
should be proportional to its surface area.
21:51
So as a black hole grows, its entropy increases.
21:55
Famous physicists thought the idea was nonsense
21:58
and for good reason.
21:59
According to classical thermodynamics,
22:01
if black holes have entropy,
22:03
then they should also have a temperature.
22:05
But if they have temperatures, they should emit radiation
22:09
and not be black after all.
22:12
The person who set out to prove Bekenstein wrong
22:15
was Stephen Hawking.
22:17
But to his surprise, his results showed that black holes
22:20
do emit radiation, now known as Hawking radiation,
22:24
and they do have a temperature.
22:27
The black hole at the center of the Milky Way
22:29
has a temperature of about a hundred trillionth of a Kelvin,
22:33
emitting radiation that is far too weak to detect.
22:36
So still pretty black.
22:38
But Hawking confirmed that black holes have entropy
22:40
and Bekenstein was right.
22:43
Hawking was able to refine Bekenstein's proposal
22:46
and determine just how much entropy they have.
22:49
The super massive black hole at the center of the Milky Way
22:51
has about 10 to the 91 Boltzmann constants of entropy.
22:56
That is 1,000 times as much
22:58
as the early observable universe,
23:00
and 10 times more than all the other particles combined.
23:04
And that is just one black hole.
23:06
All black holes together account for 3 times 10
23:09
to the 104 Boltzmann constants worth of entropy.
23:14
So almost all the entropy of the universe
23:17
is tied up in black holes.
23:19
That means, the early universe
23:21
only had about 0.000000000000003% of the entropy it has now.
Heat Death of the Universe
23:31
So the entropy was low, and everything that happens
23:35
in the universe like planetary systems forming,
23:37
galaxies merging, asteroids crashing,
23:40
stars dying, to life itself flourishing,
23:44
all of that can happen because the entropy
23:46
of the universe was low and it has been increasing,
23:50
and it all happens only in one direction.
23:52
We never see an asteroid uncrash
23:55
or a planetary system unmix
23:57
into the cloud of dust and gas that made it up.
24:00
There is a clear difference between going to the past
24:03
and the future, and that difference comes from entropy.
24:07
The fact that we are going from unlikely
24:09
to more likely states is why there is an arrow of time.
24:16
This is expected to continue until eventually,
24:20
the energy gets spread out so completely
24:22
that nothing interesting will ever happen again.
24:26
This is the heat death of the universe.
24:29
In the distant future,
24:31
more than 10 to the 100 years from now,
24:33
after the last black hole has evaporated,
24:36
the universe will be in its most probable state.
24:40
Now, even on large scales, you would not be able to tell
24:43
the difference between time moving forwards or backwards,
24:46
and the arrow of time itself would disappear.
Conclusion
24:52
So it sounds like entropy is this awful thing
24:55
that leads us inevitably
24:57
towards the dullest outcome imaginable.
25:00
But just because maximum entropy has low complexity
25:03
does not mean that low entropy has maximum complexity.
25:07
It's actually more like this tea and milk.
25:09
I mean, holding it like this is not very interesting.
25:12
But as I pour the milk in, the two start to mix
25:17
and these beautiful patterns emerge.
25:20
They arise in an instant and before you know it,
25:23
they're gone back to being featureless.
25:26
Both low and high entropy are low in complexity.
25:30
It's in the middle where complex structures
25:33
appear and thrive.
25:35
And since that's where we find ourselves,
25:37
let's make use of the low entropy we've got while we can.
25:47
