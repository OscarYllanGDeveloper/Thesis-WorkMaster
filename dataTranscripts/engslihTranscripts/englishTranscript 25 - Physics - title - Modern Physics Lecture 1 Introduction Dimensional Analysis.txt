Administrative Details
0:01
you blinking you're blinking uh okay let's go ahead and get started um my
0:07
name is Alex I am teaching physics 260 this year modern physics if you are not
0:12
in physics 260 you are in the wrong place um I'd like to begin um just by uh
0:21
going over a few administrative details for the course I just handed out a syllabus um if does anyone not have one
0:28
if someone does not have one you probably don't have one um uh this just contains some
0:35
administrative stuff that I'd like to go through um first things first I'd like to introduce our Tas Jean Bernard here
0:42
Jean Bernard ah there he is uh Jean Bernard and Marius will be the two Tas
0:47
for the course um their roles will primarily be to hold office hours to
0:52
answer questions that you might have uh to grade problem sets um and to write the solutions for
0:59
those problems uh their contact information is here uh on uh the syllabus also my contact
1:05
information is listed um my phone number my email address um I don't use my phone
1:12
number I mean you can use my phone number but it's not going to do nearly as much good as using my email address
1:17
um that email is the preferred method of communication for the course uh you guys are welcome to sit around to stay around
1:23
if you want but uh you can go eat lunch if you want to eat lunch um the rest of
1:28
you can eat lunch too oh that's fine as long as you bring enough to share that's the rule um okay um yeah so let's see we
1:37
meet three times a week uh Monday Wednesday Friday 12:30 to 1:30 uh occasionally I will have to uh be out of
1:44
town during one of the lectures uh in which case I'll find someone to give an alternate lecture sometimes these are
1:50
super special Secret Surprise lectures uh on special subjects outside of the
1:55
main uh part of the course curriculum uh unfortunately to this this Friday is one
2:00
such day when I have to miss class but I've already arranged a makeup lecture um I think there might be one or two
2:06
times uh throughout the semester and generally uh if I do have to be out of
2:11
town I'll arrange for someone to come and give a lecture just because you know I know that you guys are so excited
2:17
about physics that you couldn't bear the thought of missing a class uh so um and
2:23
if I can't do if circumstances arise where I can't find an alternate lecturer then I'll probably cancel class uh but
2:29
hopefully that won't uh have to happen um let's see Communications uh if you
2:35
are registered for this course I have your email address um that's the email address your official mck email address
2:41
that I'll be using for course announcements uh so check your email um because if I get hit by a bus and need
2:49
to cancel class that is the method by which you will find out unless I'm dead
2:54
Okay in which case I don't care um uh you can come to class anyway um let's
3:01
see if you are not registered for the class and want to just sit in for fun that's great that's fine do send me an
3:08
email so I can add your name to the email list though uh because you'll also want to know if I get hit by a bus um
3:14
also occasionally there will be type if there's a type on problem set or something like that and I need to let you guys know um I will send that all
3:22
out by email um there is a course web page uh listed on the syllabus lots of
3:27
good stuff there um other things as you may have noticed uh I lecture uh in a
3:33
slightly non-standard way uh using this tablet as you can see
3:40
um that means that all of my lectures are recorded uh by the computer uh so uh
3:48
on my course web page uh after after each lecture I will post uh the written course notes that you see right there
3:55
and also a recording of the lecture uh so if you have to miss class uh that's fine uh you can just look at the recording uh
4:02
the one caveat is that I can't guarantee that I'm going to record every lecture uh this is an old computer um it crashes
4:08
about one out of every 10 lectures so um skip class at your own risk I mean I
4:13
don't you know I have no emotional attachment to you guys attending class if you want to go uh skip class that's
4:21
fine uh but you will learn more if you come to class um let's see um yeah like
4:27
I said if you need to get in touch with me email is the best way I try to answer all emails within 24 hours um uh I've
4:34
listed office hours here Fridays 2 to 3 p.m. uh if you need to come talk to me um office hours are a guaranteed way of
4:42
uh knowing that I will be free to talk when you stop by you can always try and stop by my office some other time uh
4:48
more often than not I'm probably uh in the middle of something and so I might tell you to uh I might set him an
4:54
appointment at some other time or tell you to come back ask you to come back during office hours um if you can't make
4:59
office hours uh the best thing to do is actually send me an email and set up an appointment uh so that I can make sure
5:04
to be around and be free um let's see gring um there are three uh components
5:12
uh to your grade in this course uh problem sets midterm and the final exam
5:17
um the problem sets will be handed out weekly um Wednesdays uh in principle um
5:24
that was at least my idea uh we'll see how that goes um uh and I'm really letting you guys down by not adding out
5:31
a problem set today actually um but I decided that it would be nice and give you the first week off um so probably
5:37
what I'll do is uh on Monday I'll hand out a problem set um that'll be do the following Wednesday so I'll in general
5:44
be handing out problem sets Wednesdays they'll be due the following Wednesday at the beginning of class um if you
5:50
finish them early you can always turn them in by putting them in the physics 260 uh mailbox in the physics department
5:58
uh mail room um let's see oh yeah uh work together on
6:04
the problem sets I have no problem with that um your colleagues are a great resource there's no better way of
6:10
working through material than working through it uh together uh uh with other people um however um your problem sets
6:18
uh should reflect your own work and your own understanding um some of the
6:24
problems that I'll be using will be similar to problems that I uh used last year when I Ted this course um and I did
6:31
hand out solutions to problems that's last year uh so it is possible that those Solutions Areo floating around
6:38
however uh you are not allowed to use uh the solutions from last year's problem sets the use of those Solutions is
6:44
considered plagiarism um if I discover it or suspect it I will treat it as plagiarism so consider
6:51
unfortunately uh in the past I haven't made that announcement but unfortunately um the situation you know
6:59
based on my previous experiences I feel like I do have to make that announcement
7:04
um uh let's see uh if you uh can't turn in a problem set on time uh and you have
7:12
a valid import good uh reason then uh me the Tas and I are happy to Grant
7:18
extensions um but if you want an extension you need to contact us before the problems that's do um if you don't
7:24
get an extension we take off points for lateness uh we do hand out solutions for the problem sets um and once I hand out
7:31
solutions for the problem sets I don't take a late problem set because I think that wouldn't be fair to all the people who turned in the problem set on time um
7:38
there's a midterm um it will be in class at some uh future as yet undetermined
7:44
date there will be a final um the final will be scheduled by the uh brilliant uh
7:52
computer that schedules all of our final exams at this University um prerequisites so um I will
7:59
assume that you've had basically a year of uh freshman physics um if you were in
8:07
the uero program here that means roughly 131 and 142 or um roughly say physics um
8:14
I will also assume um a solid understanding of calculus uh linear algebra at the level
8:21
of vectors matrices uh and so forth um for example I'll assume that you're
8:26
taking math 222 concurrently with this course uh or that you've taken it before
8:32
um and more generally um I'm going to assume that you're all part of the U1 honors uh physics program so how many
8:39
people here are in the unu honors physics or math physics program my computer's asleep raise your hands again
8:45
hi okay good um you know for those of you who are not in the unu uh honors
8:51
physics program uh that's fine okay um you're welcome to take this class that's
8:56
great but you should be aware of uh what is expected Ed um and in particular um
9:02
this class is taught at a higher level um and at a faster Pace than our
9:07
standard undergraduate uh physics classes uh you should be prepared to do some reading on your own um you know I
9:14
will uh do the best I can to teach you everything you need to know but you're going to have to supplement that and
9:20
you're going to have to do a little work on the problem sets more so than in a standard undergraduate class um let's
9:27
see um oh I will also assume that you're taking this class concurrently with physics 251 which is the mechanics class
Prerequisites
9:35
how many people are taking physics 251 good okay uh if you're a unan honor student that is that you you should have
9:42
just raised your hand um I do coordinate a little bit with uh uh Robert brandenberger who teaches that class and
9:48
in particular um one of the text the textbook for that class is one of the textbooks that I will be using for this
9:54
class um as I'll describe in a minute um maybe I can just
10:00
um ask a couple words about prerequisites how many people have already taken multivariable calculus
10:07
okay good if I say if I ask you to if you know how many people know what a Jacobian
10:13
is good how many people have taken a linear algebra class good how many people um if I say
10:22
hyperbolic cosine how many people know what that is okay good if I say e to the
10:28
I is cosine thet plus I sin Theta how many people are really excited by by
10:33
that statement how many people are aware of that statement even if they're not excited by it raise your
10:40
hand good um let's see how many people have take so how many people have taken
10:46
a full year of standard freshman physics whatever that means to you you know the one where you do the stupid block
10:52
sleding down the stupid inclined planes and you do like Max I don't know you do Maxwell's equations and and stuff like
10:59
that have you guys all taken that how many people know Maxwell's equations how many people could write down Maxwell's equations if I asked them to and said
11:05
they'd fail if they couldn't do it okay how many people could write down one of Maxwell's equations okay interesting um let's see
11:15
how many people have seen special relativity in one form or another raise your hand High higher higher very high
11:23
okay how many people have seen Laurence Transformations few of
11:29
okay you'll see them again okay good thank you um let me just
11:35
say a word about the textbooks so uh frankly um this is a slightly strange
11:41
class um because uh in some ways this is a highly non- self-contained class um
11:47
the point of this class is not to take any one subject and to delve into it uh with a great deal of depth but rather to
11:54
introduce you to a broad range of uh subjects in modern physics including
11:59
relativity uh cosmology quantum mechanics Atomic physics and whatever
12:05
else I feel like teaching um and so uh for that reason I think the textbooks
12:10
for courses like this tend to be pretty poor frankly um so this the textbook
12:15
that I'm going to use for this course is this one by uh Bernstein and friends um it's pretty good um I think it's the
12:22
best of a bad lot frankly um I it has the right material at more or less the
12:27
right level but I spent a while looking at various modern physics textbooks and I didn't find I've never found any uh
12:34
one that really uh excites me um so for that reason I'm really not going to to
12:41
I'm not going to follow the the textbook particularly closely um I really am going to be writing my own lectures um
12:49
teaching it the way that I damn well please uh uh yes question sorry darn
12:55
well please darn well please um yeah good question the question is whether it's necessary to
Textbook
13:00
get the textbook I I can't you know necessary it's necessary I mean I'm not going to I'm not going to tell I'm not
13:07
going to fail you if you don't get the textbook you might fail yourself uh um I
13:12
did put the textbook on Reserve at the library um I know you can get it online for a lot cheaper than it is at the
13:18
bookstore um I encourage you to get the textbook um a fair number of the
13:24
exercises are taken from the textbook but you know you can always just go to the library and copy down the exercises
13:30
if you want um I feel like uh it would be unfair of me to not have a textbook
13:35
because it's nice to have something to hold on to um you know like even though I don't follow the textbook super
13:41
closely I am careful to use the same notation as the textbook which I think is actually pretty important and good
13:48
and I think it's really important to have something that you can read uh which is an alternative to the explanations that I give because not
13:55
every explanation works for every person so I think it's important to to have a textbook I'm not in love with this
Reference Books
14:01
particular Bernstein textbook um but I do recommend that you get it but you
14:07
could always just try and use it for the library for the first few weeks see if that if that's a total pain you could get it if it's fine then it's fine um I
14:15
mean the exams are all close book exams so it's not like you need it to take an exam anyway um let's see oh yeah so um the
14:24
first third of the course is on special relativity and I actually like the treatment of special relativity in uh
14:30
moren's book on classical physics better than I do in any of the modern physics textbooks uh that's the text book for
14:37
your uh classical mechanics class so actually for the first third of the class a better reference is this book by
14:42
Moren as opposed to the book by Bernstein um again uh most of you
14:48
probably almost all of you have it because you're taking the the the classical mechanics class if you don't
14:53
you don't need to buy it you can it's on Reserve at the library but I think it's a slightly better reference uh than the
14:58
the one by um Bernstein and friends um the other reference that I think
15:04
actually is really quite nice is that the first couple lectures I'm going to give you a little crash course on
15:10
estimation methods in physics uh dimensional analysis how many people know what I mean when I say the word
15:16
dimensional analysis interesting okay last year when I taught this class nobody had any idea
15:21
what I meant when I said dimensional analysis in some ways uh that might be the most important thing you learn in
15:27
this class it's not really textbook material um but I I did find one nice textbook uh that cover has a nice
15:34
chapter on dimensional analysis and the advantage is that it's available for free online so you can follow the link
15:41
uh on the syllabus it's also linked to on the course web page and check out the chapter and dimensional analysis on that
15:47
in that book I think it's pretty nice I actually really like that book I think it's a great little it's it's like
15:52
bedtime reading for physic um yeah it's good um I've also listed a bunch of
Other Reference Books
15:58
other really nice references I think I really love this little book by David merman on on special relativity um it's
16:05
not very mathematical it's pretty conversational um but it's a great little book oh another book that I
16:11
forgot to write down there but which is really wonderful is Einstein's book on relativity uh there's nothing more fun
16:17
than learning um at the at the feet of the Master Okay um so uh you know
16:25
Einstein's book on relative special he has a couple books two books on special relativity actually uh well one on
16:31
special and general relativity and one I think just on special relativity they're both really lovely um so they're really
16:38
not suitable for a textbook or anything like that but if you have uh the interest and the time I'd recommend
16:44
checking them out um I've recommended here two other little modern physics uh textbooks sort of very similar to the
16:51
one we're using in the class um um they're both pretty good um they're both
16:56
on Reserve at the library um and finally uh I like this book by George gamau which is just a nice
17:03
popular book again bedtime reading for physicists
17:08
um okay uh let me um now just say a little bit of um a word about what this
Course Description
17:15
course is um and and and why you're all here oh yes there we go um so
17:26
um one of the problems with the physics curriculum is that um it's front-loaded
17:33
with a lot of really boring classes okay um you know I don't want to uh say bad
17:39
things about stupid blocks sliding down stupid planes and and stuff like that because you need to learn it but uh you
17:46
do spend a lot of your time in the first couple years of your physics undergraduate studies uh studying
17:53
basically s stuff that Isaac Newton figured out you know uh 400 years ago
17:59
almost and so um I think it's a real shame uh that uh the way that our uh
18:06
physics curriculum is structured the way that everyone's physics curriculum is structured is that you don't get to the fun stuff quantum mechanics general
18:13
relativity cosmology astrophysics condensed matter physics until really uh
18:19
quite late in your education and so uh the point and so this has um a couple of
18:26
uh unpleasant side effects I think one of which is that um undergraduates are sometimes frustrated that they're
18:32
studying physics to learn all of this cool advanced stuff but they have to keep waiting and waiting and waiting before they get to it and um the other I
18:40
I think unpleasant side effect is that um you can get a little lost when you're studying all of this beautiful wonderful
18:47
classical uh mechanics and electrodynamics and all of that stuff uh you can lose a little bit of perspective
18:53
about which parts of this are important for later on in my physics career or later on in my life when I try and when
18:58
to use this to to actually do physics um and so the goal of this course is to remedy uh that situation to the extent
Course Goals
19:06
that it's possible so um uh what we're going to do here is we're going to throw you into the deep end uh you're not
19:12
ready for quantum mechanics you're not ready for general relativity you don't know all you don't have all the
19:17
background you need to fully appreciate those subjects but what we're going to do here is give you a bit of a survey of
19:25
these subjects um teach you what you can introduce some basic Notions introduce some basic ideas um which will sort of
19:33
um uh get get the juices flowing and get you excited about learning these
19:38
subjects in the future and put sort of the rest of you the undergraduate curriculum maybe in context um and
19:46
really uh my goal here is to begin to take you from the 17th century to the 20th century okay maybe the 21st century
19:53
although that might be pushing it um but uh a lot of what's going to be we're
19:58
going to study in this class is um really uh What uh physicists began to
20:05
understand uh in the first half of the 20th century um and so uh that's still
20:10
almost 100 years ago but it's much better than 3 or 400 years ago
20:16
um yeah and in addition I think um you know one sort of uh underlying goal of
20:24
this course is not just to teach you information but to teach you problem solving techniques um and to teach you
20:31
the way and to at least begin to teach you the way that physicists actually think about physics as opposed to just
20:38
uh Stupid blocks sliding down stupid inclined planes or something like that okay um so uh I've written here a very
Course Outline
20:46
uh a telegraphic outline of the course um it's a little sketchy um roughly
20:51
speaking the next couple lectures I'll do uh some general stuff dimensional analysis where are we going in this
20:57
class um estimation techniques um I'll spend another good
21:03
chunk of the course on special relativity um the special relativity portion of the course is going to be
21:09
divided into two parts um there's a part on the kinematics of special relativity
21:14
uh lawence Transformations SpaceTime um length contraction time dilation all that stuff before moving on
21:21
to the Dynamics of special relativity uh energy equals mc^2 Mass momentum uh um
21:28
scattering processes and things like that um then what I'll do is I'll move on to a discussion of general relativity
21:36
which is the extension of special relativity to include um gravity I'll talk a little bit about the curvature of
21:42
SpaceTime and about its implications uh the most important of which is for cosmology um the section on special
21:49
relativity is going to be quite precise um because you are at a point in your careers where you should be able to
21:55
understand everything about special relativity and understand it well um the section on general relativity general
22:01
relativity is going to be a bit more uh schematic um because the math required
22:06
for a full study of gr um is a bit beyond you at this point um but nevertheless there are a lot of
22:12
interesting things to say uh especially about cosmology um and then in the
22:17
second half of the course we're going to move on to Quantum Mechanics uh so uh
22:22
I'll start out by discussing um the bore model how many of you have seen the bore model
22:28
okay good well we'll uh do it better um we'll do a better job and put it in um a
22:36
you know more of a a context hopefully than you've seen it before uh before
22:41
moving on to quantum mechanics and so the last I would say third of this course is just going to be a kind of uh
22:48
schematic introduction to Quantum Mechanics um and to its implications and
22:55
quantum mechanics is to some extent the subject in physics um it is um the the
23:03
most I think probably the most important subject that you will learn um as
23:08
undergraduates in a physics major um and it's a difficult subject and one that
23:13
takes a long time to wrap your heads around and so that is uh a process that
23:20
we will begin in this class but one that will not end uh for quite a while uh if it ever does okay um and then I put
23:28
special topics I always put special topics at the end of a syllabus because it means that if I have time I can talk
23:33
about whatever I want to talk about any
23:39
questions no questions let me just say a word about
23:46
uh the way that I teach um I understand that there are many people here uh from a lot of different
23:52
backgrounds some people coming from sageep some from uzzo some from who knows where um and so for that reason I
24:00
never quite know whether what I'm saying is hitting the mark Or Not um and the
24:05
only way that I know whether you are understanding uh what I'm saying is if I get feedback from you so for that reason
24:12
I really want to encourage all of you to ask lots of questions I will be personally disappointed in each and
24:19
every one of you if I do not get lots of
24:24
questions okay have I laid it on okay so I want a question any
24:30
questions yeah nope um we will decide that
24:36
um uh by a uh quasi Democratic process whereby you will vote on things and then
24:42
I will make a decision because it's not a democracy um but we'll we'll we'll we'll come to that uh later on I mean we
24:48
could decide it now for all I care but yeah let's do it later any other questions yes are you going to be
24:55
introducing any real differential geometry from the G section or you just kind n I'll handwave it I mean um yeah
25:02
as I said gr is a topic that um is mathematically I mean it's something
25:08
that mathematically if you wanted to spend a semester learning gr if I wanted to spend this whole semester teaching a gr I could teach you gr
25:16
um it's nothing there's nothing too complicated about it I mean I think a
25:22
high school student could learn general relativity um if they put their minds to it but it's the sort of thing that I
25:28
don't think that we just have time to devote you know a full semester to studying and so for that reason I'm
25:33
going to be a little sketchy I'll introduce the vocabulary I mean frankly a lot of this course is uh about
25:40
vocabulary it's about my telling you words and saying those words often enough that later in life when you hear
25:46
someone say that word you're not scared okay you think oh geodesic I've heard of
25:52
a geodesic it's this thing in gr that tells me how objects move when space curves
25:58
and you don't necessarily need to know the geodesic equation or the christopal connection or anything fancy like that
26:04
but you'll have the basic idea okay and you'll more importantly know where you can look to find out more and that place
26:10
of course is Wikipedia um yes any any other questions
26:17
yeah no other questions yes when you see
26:26
that questions no this is a Physics course so that everything's you
Essay Questions
26:33
know the ex you know I mean uh there's no yeah there are no essay questions in
26:39
this course um it does mean it you know I will give you bits and pieces of the
26:44
mathematics that you need um I will do my best to make this course self-contained uh to some extent that's
26:50
a real challenge for me for a course like this um I actually uh for long time advocated
26:58
cancelling this course because so I think that I was then asked to teach it um it's a bit of cosmic
27:07
Justice uh but um I think that uh because I
27:12
think this is an unusual course okay um because it is not uh the standard
27:18
Physics course you systematically develop everything from the beginning to the end of a subject and you end up with
27:23
a nice coherent beautiful picture um and we and that's what we'll do for special
27:28
relativity we'll start at the beginning we'll end at the end and at the end of the day we'll have some beautiful physics that we can understand
27:35
completely okay um but that will only take us four weeks okay um and so then
27:41
we'll go on and do a little bit more of a survey of these various different topics but no we don't do essay
27:46
questions uh we do math and we do physics okay because we're a real physicist any other
27:55
questions yes ofch what is my field of research my field of research is
28:00
theoretical particle physics String Theory black holes Quantum cosmology um I'm happy to answer
28:08
questions about my field of research but actually what I've done in the past is that as a reward the lecture after the
28:15
midterm I uh will give a talk about my research I know you must be as
28:21
fascinated by as I am okay um yeah uh so
28:26
yeah I'm happy to talk about my research but um and it's if you want me to stop
28:31
talking about whatever I'm talking about a good way of doing that is asking me about my research and I say Alex tell me
28:37
about the quantum mechanics of black Halles I'll immediately drop whatever I'm doing but no uh but let's talk about
28:43
uh modern physics instead any other
28:49
questions good please interrupt me and ask questions at any point um Okay so
Modern Physics
28:57
now my computer is
29:03
asleep yeah see this is why I promise are you awake that I'm not going to reliably
29:10
record the lectures is this thing on it's
29:19
okay he ah there we go yeah I can't wait until
29:29
Apple makes one of these things and then um it just work okay
29:35
good so um what is the goal of this class so um the goal of this class is to
29:42
go beyond the standard picture of Newtonian physics um that you've learned so far in your classes for example on
29:49
classical mechanics so our goal is to go beyond Newtonian
29:56
physics
30:04
and so what do I mean by Newtonian physics well I mean the classical Laws of Motion fals
30:12
Ma and all of the various weird and wonderful consequences
30:17
thereof and before diving into any particular details of Relativity or
30:23
quantum mechanics I would just like to set the stage for you a little bit and talk about the types of modifications to
30:30
Newtonian physics that we will be discussing in this course and I would like to give you a few methods for at
30:36
least estimating the basic strength and size of these modifications to Newtonian
30:44
physics and there are really two types of uh
30:49
effects that we will be discussing and these are really the two substantial modifications to Newtonian physics that
30:57
were discovered in the early 20th century namely modifications of Newtonian physics due to Quantum effects
31:05
and modifications due to relativistic
31:11
effects and before even describing in detail what the nature of these effects
31:18
are I think it's important to step back a little bit and ask under what
31:24
circumstances these effects will be important because learning special relativity is all well and good but if
31:31
you just want to understand for example the amount of time it will take for this box of chalk to hit the floor if I drop
31:37
it then you need to understand you need to understand why it is you don't need to know special relativity or quantum
31:43
mechanics or Nuclear Physics or anything like that in order to estimate the amount of time it'll take for this box
31:49
of chalk to hit the floor but I'm not going to actually drop it um so uh in
31:54
order to do so um what I want to do is uh spend the first two or three lectures
32:01
discussing dimensional analysis and dimensional analysis is the
Dimensional Analysis
32:07
tool that we will use to analyze uh the strength of these
32:17
effects which are governed by two
32:26
parameters the strength of relativistic effects is
32:34
are governed by uh a quantity CL C which is the speed of
32:42
light and the strength of quantum effects is governed by a quantity we call H which is Plank's
32:55
constant and so if you want to understand whether for example special relativity is going to be relevant when
33:03
considering a given physical situation the question you need to ask yourself is
33:08
are the typical velocities that are arising in this problem greater than or
33:13
of order the speed or less than or of order the speed of light so for example if I drop a piece of chalk from here
33:21
onto the floor then the typical veloc the velocity of that uh object as I drop it is is far far far below the speed of
33:29
light which means that the strength of relativistic effects are going to be
33:34
very small um and uh on the other hand for
33:40
example if I take this piece of chalk and I drop it into a black hole okay then the strength of relativistic
33:46
effects will be quite important and so um our goal then is just to develop a
33:51
little bit of intuition for estimating the size of these effects
33:58
so let me just uh tell you
34:03
uh some vocabulary I told you this was a course on vocabulary so U let me draw an axis here
34:11
okay this is not a schematic plot this is a moral plot the vertical axis is special as
34:22
relativity so as you increase along the vertical axis relativistic effects become important and as you
34:30
increase along the horizontal axis quantum mechanics effects become
34:36
important so here in uh the lower leftand
34:41
corner where neither effect is
34:46
important the laws class the laws of physics are governed by the laws of
34:54
classical mechanics and then as relativistic effects become more important uh special
35:01
relativity takes
35:08
over so for example uh if the velocity of uh the object that you're considering
35:14
is of order of the speed of light then special relativity rather than classical mechanics is the appropriate set of
35:20
rules of physics to use whereas if quantum mechanics uh become important
35:26
then class IAL mechanics is replaced by quantum mechanics that's why it's called quantum
35:31
mechanics and then if both uh relativistic and quantum mechanical
35:38
effects are important then uh we have up here in the upper right hand corner uh
35:44
particle phys well it has it's a field which has a lot of different names you could call it relativistic quantum
35:50
mechanics or you could call it quantum field Theory or you could call it particle
35:57
physics uh they're all more or less uh different terms for the same thing which
36:03
is the Theory of physics that uh is needed to describe situations where both relativity and quantum mechanics are
36:10
important and it's important to emphasiz of course that it's not that Newton's laws are wrong it's just that they have
36:17
a regime of validity which is governed by those two parameters C and H that I
36:23
drew at the top of this slide and in order to
36:30
estimate the size of these
36:37
effects it's useful to use dimensional
36:47
analysis and dimensional analysis is a very fancy term for a very
36:54
very simple yet powerful idea so in order to explain dimensional
37:00
analysis to you let me REM let me remind you of something that you already
37:06
know which is that many physical
37:12
quantities that we will be concerned with in studying a given physical problem are measured in some System of
37:25
Units for example you might measure the length of
37:32
some object and if you're using the SI system of units you would measure its length in
37:38
meters whereas if you're using the CGS System of Units you would measure it in
37:44
centim whereas if you were measuring the mass of the object you would measure that either in kilograms or in
37:52
GRS or an interval of time would be measured in either seconds uh or
37:59
seconds it's a joke cuz seconds is the same okay never mind um and
38:08
um these three different units length mass and time are the basic set of units
38:16
out of which all other quantities that we are interested in studying in physics uh are defined well there are other
38:22
sorts of units such as for charge and so forth which one can add in addition to this but as far as
38:31
studying um uh mechanics uh these are the three basic quantities of
Terminology
38:39
Interest so let me now introduce a bit of
38:44
terminology so a quantity which is the
38:50
same in every System of Units
38:59
is called
39:05
dimensionless and a quantity which is not the
39:12
same is called Dimension
39:18
f for example the length of this pen is a dimensionful quantity because uh in
39:26
the SI units I would measure it in meters whereas in the CGS units I would measure it in centimeters and those two
39:33
uh numbers would differ by a factor of 100 so the length of this pen is a dimensionful quantity whereas the ratio
39:39
of the length of a pen to a length of a piece of chalk is a dimensionless quantity that ratio is the same no
39:47
matter what system of units I use to make those measurements the factor of 100 would
Notation
39:55
cancel and so so for example we often use um a little piece of notation when
40:01
describing the dimensions of various objects so a linear
40:08
size or length of an object has
40:14
Dimension well it has Dimension length and so if for example you're
40:19
measuring the radius of an object R and you want to remind yourself that it has Dimensions length we would
40:28
say that we would put uh well I guess there are variety of different notations
40:34
that people use uh the notation that is most common is you would put the quantity in Brackets and say it goes
40:41
like length you know the little squiggly sign meaning that it goes like uh I didn't teach you that in math class uh L
40:48
for length whereas for example uh an
40:54
area has dimension length
40:59
squared so that the area of some object goes like length
41:05
squared and uh a length of time likewise would have uh dimensions of time uh a
41:13
mass would have dimensions of mass so we could also
41:19
uh you know the length of time would go like time and a mass would go like Mass
41:27
but we also have various derived
41:33
quantities which are built up out of these three basic Dimensions length mass and
41:39
time so for example the velocity of an
41:46
object will go like length divided by time because it is the distance that an
41:54
object will travel uh in per in a given amount of time and so the velocity of an
42:00
object is dimension full but the ratio of the velocity of an object to the
42:05
speed of light is dimensionless because it's a velocity divided by a velocity the lengths cancel and the times
42:12
cancel uh energy for example has Dimensions who tell who can
42:18
tell me what the dimensions of energy are hint mc^ 2
42:27
energy has dimensions of uh mass time velocity so Mass * length squar ided
42:35
time squar um the quick and dirty way of figuring out the dimensions of your
42:41
favorite quantity in physics is to just remember your favorite physics formula
42:47
and uh use that um so for example uh if you want to figure out the dimensions of
42:52
force FAL ma a a is the derivative of velocity with respect to time so it has
42:59
dimensions of uh length over time squared so
43:05
Force has dimensions of mass time acceleration so Mass length over time
43:14
squar uh how about let's do another example density the density of an object is the
43:21
amount of mass per unit volume so that will have dimensions of mass over length
43:27
cubed volume of course going like length cubed
43:35
and the important point the point that I cannot stress
43:41
enough is that any physical
43:48
law should be
43:53
independent of the system of units
44:01
used to write that
44:11
law so in particular any valid physics
44:20
equation say a equals B
44:28
should relate
44:33
quantities with the same
44:45
units and um a corollary of this observation is that any physical
44:54
law can be written in terms of dimensionless
45:13
quantities um to see why that's true let's imagine that we have a physical law a equals B where A and B both have
45:20
dimensions of length for example then in order to write that in terms of dimensionless qu quties just rewrite
45:27
that as a / B equal 1 A and B both have dimensions of length a b is
45:34
dimensionless and very often the best way of understanding the physics of a given uh system is to write everything
45:41
in terms of dimensionless quantities and then try and understand how those dimensionless quantities are related to
45:46
one another and the important point is that
45:52
this observation that every law of physics Rel relates quantities with the same uh with the same Dimension
46:01
constrains the possible laws of physics so this
46:08
constrains the possible laws of
46:18
physics um for example it tells
46:24
us that no law of
46:31
physics involves the exponential of a
46:42
length it's why well what is let's imagine that I have uh a quantity say uh
46:49
the length of a piece of chalk L and I want to write down a physical
46:54
law that is obeyed by this piece of chalk say a law describing its rotation
47:00
as I subject it to some forces or something like that then the exponential
47:07
of that length of a piece of chalk well what is the exponential it's definition
47:12
is in terms of a tailor expansion 1 + L + 12 l^ 2 plus dot dot
47:20
dot this involves the addition of something with Dimension One plus
47:26
something with Dimension length or something dimensionless rather something which has Dimension One Plus something
47:32
with Dimension length plus something with Dimension length squared and so on and so forth so any law which involves
47:40
only the exponential of um the length of the piece of chalk can't possibly be
47:46
written in terms of uh uh can't possibly relate only quantities which have the same Dimension so this is no
47:54
good but what could make sense for example is
48:00
an exponential of the length of the piece of chalk divided by some other
48:06
length scale okay so if you have another length scale in the problem another
48:11
quantity with dimensions of length in the problem then this of course is the exponential of a dimensionless quantity
48:18
so it's dimensionless and this is okay so a quick and dirty way of
48:26
understanding whether any result that you have derived in some problems that for example uh is plausible is to check
48:33
that it only relates quantities which have the same
48:39
Dimension and then uh along with um this
Two Basic Principles
48:45
uh observation that the laws of physics um
48:51
uh only relate quantities with the same uh dimension we have two basic
49:04
principles the first is the principle of dimensional analysis and the second is I
49:10
guess I would call it a principle uh it's more a dirty trick which is that for obtaining order of magnitude
49:21
estimates so I will just say them in words um although we'll en under them more uh next class but the principle of
49:29
dimensional analysis says that if you have a problem involving a bunch of
49:34
physical quantities but it's only possible to form one dimensionless combination of these quantities then
49:41
that dimensionless combination must be a constant likewise if you are trying to
49:48
solve some Physics problem and you can only form two dimensionless quantities from all of the various inputs to your
49:55
problem then that one of them must be a function of the
50:00
other so if you I want you to think about this and think about why it is that this is a consequence of the
50:07
observations about physical laws that I've made earlier in this class and then
50:12
the second principle that I've written here that of order of magnitude estimates is the statement that in
50:18
general if you have a dimensionless quantity one of the the the the the the pieces of uh truth in physics uh is that
50:28
if you have a dimensionless uh combination of quantities then most likely it's of order
50:35
one and if it's not of order one there better be a good reason so let me give you an
50:42
example the uh rules of physics the basic laws of
50:49
physics are governed by three dimensionful quantities the speed of light Plank's constant and Newton's
50:55
constant which determines the strength of gravitation from those one can construct
51:00
one and only one length scale therefore you would guess based on
51:06
this order of magnitude estimate that the size of the universe should be this length
51:12
scale so your homework assignment this is one of those homework assignments that's not on a problem set but one that
51:18
you do to become a better physicist is to go and calculate that length scale and compare it to the size of the
51:23
universe and see of this order of magnet itude estimate uh is
51:29
true give you a hint it's wrong okay um it's okay so your homework problem is to
51:36
figure out how many orders of magnitude it's off by give you okay oh you go look up the
51:42
speed of light speed of light uh what 3 * 10 10 cm/s look up Newton's constant
51:49
uh look up Plank's constant form the dimensional form the quantity uh out of
51:55
those three uh objects which has dimensions of length compared to the size of the universe the universe is
52:00
what 10 billion light years across just do it it's a fun exercise okay um that
52:06
would be an example of when this order of magnitude estimate is wrong that's 10 okay um it's uh uh 125
52:15
uh so I will go ahead and uh end here and um see you guys uh next
52:24
class
