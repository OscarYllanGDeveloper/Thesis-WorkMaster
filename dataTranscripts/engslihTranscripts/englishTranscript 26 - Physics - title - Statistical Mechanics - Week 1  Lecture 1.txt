0:08
first of all let's look at the handouts I have given to you just to give you
0:18
some general information about the course in the cost guidelines I
0:26
underlined my aims as to teach the basic tools of classical and quantum
0:33
statistical mechanics and to demonstrate how thermodynamic laws and results may
0:41
be obtained by using the statistical mechanics well of course
0:48
my second aim is to demonstrate how tell dynamic laws and results when when you
1:02
applied the system mechanics to a wide variety of physical branches you will
1:11
see automatically the range of system mechanics I'm going to give you examples
1:18
from condensed matter astrophysics and nuclear physics and the related fields
1:26
okay and of course my last aim is to
1:31
enable you to read the literature containing Cisco mechanical ideas
1:38
related to your own field of study the textbook is patria second or third
1:49
edition of the book is going to be used I'm going to be concentrating on the third and latest but you can use the
1:58
second law second edition if you like we
2:04
have that book I think that's also a good reference the other reference books
2:09
are who and Cisco mechanics rave from
2:16
the matters of Cisco thermal physics londa ellipsis Cisco physics these are
2:24
all good books it supplements our own textbook and I think any graduate course
2:32
should use more than one book syllabus I
2:40
intend to go along with patreon and do
2:48
eight almost chapters dealing with the
2:54
ideal systems but I'm going to be a little fast on those so that I have
3:00
enough time for interacting systems interactions between particles are
3:06
responsible for example for tech phase transitions and we have to do them to
3:12
really understand the the wide scope of Cisco mechanics well the other
3:20
administrative stutz things are summarized homeworks are going to be
3:27
given to midterms and a final will complete our grading efforts so that's
3:38
the course guidelines I have also given you an questionnaire I want you to fill
3:45
that in so that I know how much you know what books we have studied ok please
3:52
fill that in and give it to me in the break now let's go to the main subject
4:04
of Cisco mechanics but before that I have to ask you a question should I
4:12
assume that you know sensical thermodynamics which is the undergraduate course in this department
4:20
do you know surgical thermodynamics
4:26
why did you take it from this University
4:33
but you are not sure whether you know it or not you fail it how can you come
4:45
recitation I see so well I usually will assume that
4:52
but I'll try to make it a a complete
4:57
course so you don't need to go to any other lecture knows if you would like to
5:05
do that you got perfectly welcome to do that but I will try to be giving a
5:11
complete set of lectures so you will it will be self-contained
5:19
self-explanatory but if you need anything that requires the previous
5:26
knowledge you can stop me and ask questions so it's asking questions is
5:33
the most important thing you can do in physics okay if you just sit there and
5:39
take notes I think it will not be a good attitude towards physics okay this is
5:48
not a lecture to sit and take notes only but we should interact during the class
5:56
you should stop and ask questions whenever you like okay now I will start
6:05
with the concept of macroscopic and microscopic stage variables that
6:14
describe a system you know in Cesco mechanics we are dealing with a large
6:21
system compared with those we studying quantum mechanics well the number of
6:31
particles in our system is about ten to twenty three of the
6:38
order of ten to twenty three a gram of
6:45
any material has that much okay and of
6:53
course when you take so many particles you'll see immediately that more is
7:01
different as said by one of the famous physicists more is different so you can
7:11
saw the single particle properties but you have so many particles you are going
7:18
to get something different the physics will get more challenging in some sense
7:23
okay well we usually look at these
7:28
systems in thermodynamic limit where the
7:40
particle numbers is going to infinity very large number and the volume goes to
7:49
infinity but the number density stays
7:57
constant as the totemic
8:05
limit well in this limit of course the
8:12
extensive properties of the system some properties are extensive
8:27
are directly proportional to the size of the system then that means proportional
8:48
to number of particles and volume of system that defines the size isn't so
9:01
intensive properties on the other hand
9:15
independent of science okay now you can
9:27
take it as a definition of extensive and intensive properties if a property is
9:33
depending on the size of the system it is expensive if it is independent of the
9:40
size of the system it is intensive now
9:52
let's write the total energy and number of particles of course we are going to
10:01
take the particles non-interacting up to
10:10
chapters nine or ten okay non-interacting particles the systems
10:18
are they containing non-interacting particles are known as ideal systems
10:26
okay ideal gas for example is a collection of atoms or molecules which
10:33
are not interacting with shot with each other they are of course in real life they are interacting but we are assuming
10:40
no interactions to make the analysis of their physics easy okay so it is the
10:52
first approximation to life if they are not interacting you can write the energy
11:00
of the system as a sum of energies of
11:09
independent particles epsilon I in this
11:15
case and I is the number of particles having that specific energy
11:24
so that the numbers total number of particles in the system is nothing but
11:30
the sum was particles having different
11:40
energies
11:47
so when you look at the system quantum mechanically of course you immediately
11:56
underline the fact that the energies are discrete aren't they do you know when
12:05
the energies are discrete quantized in other words do you know the rule for
12:13
quantization of energies so if you don't
12:19
ask questions I will ask questions okay that's the rule in this course what is
12:29
the reason for quantization of energy of a system of as in individual particle do
12:40
you know this have you studied quantum mechanics hmm of course because you are
12:51
graduate students so what is the reason for quantization of energy our usual
13:00
asked questions and answered them myself it is what confinement is in it when you
13:10
confine the particle to a small region of space either by interactions between
13:16
particles like the Coulomb interaction isn't it like in atoms molecules the
13:25
energy becomes quantized in a hydrogen atom the region of space is more or less
13:34
having a radius of 1 Bohr radius isn't it Oh point 5 to 9
13:41
angstrom so
13:48
if you confine the particles in a very small region of space you quantize the
13:59
energies if you let the particle move in
14:05
a large part of space let it be a free
14:11
particle for example you don't have conversational energies and you can take
14:18
the energy to be a continuous variable okay so confinement when the confinement
14:27
means if you put the particles in a box like a gas in a box you are quantizing
14:35
their energies depending on the end of the box charism of one side so in
14:47
quantum mechanics these are quantized
15:00
so we can specify them it if we know our
15:10
system man well it also means from this
15:18
discussion very quickly that they depend on me is in a 2-volume confinement means
15:27
small volume so the energies are volume dependent extremely important if these
15:40
individual energies are quantized then they II totally II is also context isn't
15:49
isn't it can also be quantized now if
15:59
the volume is large then you can treat
16:06
these energies as continues you should
16:11
really understand this because you usually later in the course you are
16:19
going to turn some nations into integrals by assuming that the volume is
16:25
large the volume you're dealing with is large and you're taking energies to be
16:32
continuous variables only in that case you can change as some into an integral
16:40
is energy okay now in this case then if you can treat
16:54
them as well their continuous variables then you have number of particles in
17:02
your system volume of your system and the total energy can really describe
17:11
your system microscopically isn't it so
17:16
we call these well set of these values
17:23
defining a microstate
17:34
a macrostate of a given system can be described in terms of number of
17:42
particles volume of the system and energy total energy of the system now of
17:51
course any macro state is going to be
17:57
having a lot of microstates in it okay
18:03
because if take a gas of atoms or
18:08
molecules particles let's say those particles would be in continual motion
18:16
isn't it they are going to move all over the
18:21
place you within the box they may have
18:27
occasional collisions between themselves and walls of the box so there's
18:37
microscopic motion will be quite rich
18:43
giving out probably the same microstate so let's look at this concept of
18:52
microstates then a little bit closely and I'll give you a toy example to
18:58
really make you understand what the microstates are okay let's take a very
19:07
simple toy model of three particles with
19:14
spin one health three particles with spin one health it is of course nothing
19:23
to do with our large real systems what
19:29
gives us a bad pedagogical example that gives us a nice idea of microstates
19:46
three particles with spin one out let's
19:58
take it talking about Samuel in this
20:05
case isn't it let's take an external
20:11
field magnetic field along that axis so
20:27
you can immediately write the potential energy of a spin a particle in this
20:35
field what is that - Mira be more muted H isn't it so energy then
20:47
is going to be minus mu H of spin up
20:55
that means alongs and all it is plus mu
21:05
H when the spin is opposite to the field isn't it need not be a dot product gives
21:13
you plasma range so there are two states
21:18
if it is down spin now let's consider
21:27
this three spin system explicitly and decide on the energies individual
21:38
particles and total energy of the system
21:46
so I am trying to make a contact with your earlier course so that we
21:52
understand the basic ideas now let's
21:58
take the individual possible states of the system
22:04
well quantum numbers if you like and
22:10
total magnetic moment or total and the
22:21
energy of the system
22:30
the first state I will show the up with
22:37
plus down with - okay the first stage
22:44
was number them well all of them may be
22:52
up if all of them are up each one will
22:59
contribute an energy minus mu age but will be the total energy minus 3 mu H is
23:07
in it well total magnetic moment is 2 mu and
23:16
energy is minus 3 mu age the second
23:24
state could be that one of these spacers
23:30
down as in the following three examples
23:45
I told you it's a toy problem well if
23:52
one is down it cancels one of the
23:59
remaining two so for this tree the total
24:08
magnetic moment is mu 2 up 1 down this 2
24:15
cancels of total is mu the energy becomes minus nu H is in it for the tree
24:29
so that is the property of those states
24:36
three states let's look at the fifth one now to maybe down if this is the case we
24:47
have three more states six seven up down
24:58
down down up down for those three now
25:11
mainly down isn't it the total state so
25:16
it is minus mu the energy is going to be
25:21
plus mu H for all three isn't it and the
25:29
last state is going to be all of them
25:34
are down these are the total possibilities in this case magnetic
25:45
moment is minus 3 mu and energy is plus
25:50
3 mewn page so I think that is all the
26:03
possibilities isn't it imagine doing this with ten to twenty
26:09
three particles impossible isn't it you cannot even write the possibilities but
26:18
it's a pedagogical example so you can't follow it now let's consider the idea of
26:29
accessible stage have you heard about this before number of accessible stage
26:36
to your system well let's imagine that
26:43
we know the total energy of the system let's think about the system was total
26:51
energies - mu range we know that that's assumed we know that if the total energy
27:03
is minus mu age are all these states available to the system the system
27:11
cannot be in this state cannot be in any one of these three states because total
27:18
energy is minus mage they don't match it cannot be in that state - it can only be
27:26
in these three states that's the concept
27:34
of accessible stage to the system it may have a possibility of more states to be
27:42
in but if you fix the total energy the number of states available to the system
27:49
may be smaller isn't it as in this case instead of eight it has
27:57
three accessible okay that is the concept of accessible
28:08
stays okay of course if you look at this
28:20
previous example how many microstate
28:28
will be available for a system like this that can be described by total number of
28:35
particles and volume V and non energy E it must be huge number of microscopic
28:44
states available to the system isn't it that's the idea of microscopic
28:52
microstates a huge number of microstates
29:23
in quantum mechanics of course you had to define the system by a wave function
29:28
that involves all the positions of the
29:37
particles in your system corresponding to the same energy e now you have
29:46
learned in your undergraduate siskel thermodynamics course that we
29:51
have two main postulates that we do make
29:56
about their systems do you remember those postulates No
30:23
okay let me remind you that it is nice to remember what you have done before if
30:30
you don't remember them just go back and read your lecturers okay now the first
30:39
postulate is fell in here if the total
30:55
damages - mu H the system can be in any one of these states with equal
31:02
probabilities in it there is nothing that separates these microstates for
31:08
emissions and that's postulate number one say says at any time T so I'm
31:24
reviewing in some sense your undergraduate course the system is
31:37
equally likely to be in any one of these
31:54
microstates
32:11
well you can't read this it is an extremely important postulate it is nice
32:21
to understand with these simple model problems but you have to read the
32:27
philosophy behind it ekoo a priori probabilities there is
32:35
nothing that differentiates one microstate form and others and it is
32:40
equally probable to find a system in any one of these microstates this is
32:46
extremely important and let's call the
32:53
number of these microstates all possible
33:03
microstates
33:12
Omega which is going to be a function of
33:18
that of course if you changed the number of particles that number will change if
33:25
you change the volume and total energy as you can see from this simple example
33:31
it will change now this number is an
33:39
extremely important quantity and we can drive the whole thermodynamics permit ok
33:48
Toa dynamic properties of the system from this innocent-looking number ok
33:56
extremely important to understand that for example the contact between
34:04
statistics and thermodynamics is coming from that number do you know the contact
34:13
with this number and entropy for example
34:29
you are going to remember something if you try a little bit harder the entropy
34:38
you have seen this I think it is both one constant times the logarithm of this
34:47
number well that number can be huge like ten to return to tree but if you take
34:55
the logarithm it is 23 isn't it
35:00
have you seen this before yeah all of you have seen this well that
35:10
brings us to that is the contact with thermodynamics if you know entropy you
35:15
can drive all other thermodynamic quantities of course now the second
35:22
postulate comes for the equilibrium of a
35:27
system what is the equilibrium state because equilibrium well the course has
35:34
equilibrium fiscal mechanics the name of equilibrium statistical mechanics we are
35:41
not going to do non equilibrium statistical mechanics which which is another course of course so in in this
35:50
course we have to understand what equilibrium is we are going to discuss
35:58
that a little bit more I know you know the concept but we're going to discuss
36:04
it then postulate number two
36:14
equilibrium of the system corresponds to
36:30
maximum Omega that means maximum entropy
36:41
of course the entropy of a system is in
36:55
some sense the measure of disorder in the system and here the accordion
37:08
corresponds to a maximum entropy
37:15
probably had some simple examples for
37:24
understanding this postulate for example
37:29
a loaded dice is a nice example to think about possible microstates of a loaded dice if
37:40
it is loaded that is if the dice is in
37:46
the hands of and not so honest person
37:53
he can't roll it and get a 60 each time it throws it it is a lot of dice isn't
38:01
it so the outcome is only one state but if
38:07
the dice is an honest dies you have six possibilities for each draw isn't it so
38:18
in what case this order is maximum
38:25
six faces coming with equal probability
38:30
of course because in the other case there is no disorder at all each stroke
38:37
is at the same state perfect orders in some sense isn't it so what is
38:45
the entropy in the one state case
38:51
looking at that expression logarithm
38:57
Omega logarithm one is zero isn't it Ln one is zero so entropy is zero in that
39:04
case it's perfectly ordered state but in
39:11
the other case honest eyes you have what
39:16
Ln you have six states so it is maximum
39:22
in that case isn't it so in that sense we really understand
39:28
again every toy example but gives an idea of disorder and the is relation
39:35
with entropy isn't it so yes it is
39:43
related to disorder in your system now
39:51
do you have any questions with these topics anything that you want to ask we
40:00
have to interact you remember so
40:08
equilibrium for example if I have two systems in contact with each other and
40:15
the content only allows a energy
40:20
transfer from one to another of course from the subsystem with larger
40:27
temperatures double dead heat transferred to a low temperature system
40:34
when is the equilibrium going to be established
40:46
come on the seat transfer will will continue till the temperatures are equal
40:53
isn't it now if I let this separator
40:59
between two systems move at the same time then is going to be the equilibrium
41:08
between these two systems or the total system will be Nikko Bremen
41:16
if the separator is mobile it depends on the pressure on both sides whether it's
41:24
going to move from a high pressure to a low pressure region so that equilibrium
41:32
will be established when the pressures are equal along the temperatures aren't
41:37
they now if I make the separators to
41:43
allow the particle exchange between two systems particle exchange so transfer of
41:50
particles for Monta and others then are we going to have the equilibrium
42:02
exactly very good question answered when the chemical potentials between two
42:09
systems are equal the chemical potentials of two systems re GU so if
42:18
there is a gradient in temperature of course there will be heat flow from high
42:24
temperature region to a low temperature region or system and if the chemical
42:35
potential is high in one system in contact with a low chemical potential
42:41
system particles will flow from the hype chemical potential to low chemical
42:46
potential isn't it do you remember this have you done this
42:51
before yeah of course you have done it
43:02
you
