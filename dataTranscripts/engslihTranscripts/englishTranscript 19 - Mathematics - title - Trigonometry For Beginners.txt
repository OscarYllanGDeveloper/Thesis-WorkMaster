Introduction
0:02
have you ever heard of the expression
0:04
sohcahtoa
0:07
what do you think this expression means
0:11
in this lesson we're going to focus on
0:13
right triangle trigonometry
0:15
let's say if this is the angle theta
0:19
now there's three sides of this triangle
0:21
that you need to be familiar with
0:24
opposite to theta this is the opposite
0:26
side
0:28
and next to the angle of theta is the
0:29
adjacent side
0:32
and across the box or the right angle of
0:34
the triangle which is the hypotenuse
0:38
that's the longer side of the triangle
0:42
now if you recall
0:45
this is a b and c the pythagorean
0:48
theorem applies to right triangles a
0:50
squared plus b squared is equal to c
0:52
squared
0:53
but we're not going to focus on that too
0:55
much but just be familiar with that
0:56
equation
1:01
now let's talk about the six trig
1:02
functions in terms of sine cosine
1:05
tangent
1:06
opposite adjacent hypotenuse
1:09
sine theta
1:11
according to sohcahtoa
1:13
s is for sine o is for opposite h is for
1:15
hypotenuse sine theta is equal to the
1:18
opposite side
1:19
divided by the hypotenuse
1:22
cosine theta
1:24
is equal to the adjacent side
1:26
divided by the hypotenuse
1:29
k
1:29
is for cosine is adjacent over
1:31
hypotenuse
1:33
and tangent theta
1:36
toa
1:37
is equal to the opposite side divided by
1:40
the adjacent side so that's the tangent
1:42
ratio it's opposite over adjacent
1:45
now we know that cosecant
1:47
is one over sine so cosecant is
1:50
basically hypotenuse divided by the
1:52
opposite side you just need to flip
1:56
this particular fraction
1:58
secant
1:59
is the reciprocal
2:01
of cosine so secant is going to be
2:03
hypotenuse divided by the adjacent side
2:07
cotangent
2:08
is the reciprocal of tangent so if
2:10
tangent is opposite over adjacent
2:12
cotangent is adjacent divided by the
2:15
opposite side
Example
2:17
now let's say if we're given
2:19
a right triangle
2:22
and we have the value of two sides let's
2:25
say this is three and this is four
2:27
and here is the angle theta
2:29
find the missing side of this right
2:31
triangle
2:32
and then
2:34
find the values of all six trigonometric
2:37
functions sine cosine tangent secant
2:39
cosecant cotangent
2:42
now to find the missing side
2:43
we need to use the pythagorean theorem
2:46
a squared plus b squared is equal to c
2:48
squared
2:49
so a is three b is four
2:52
and we gotta find missing side
2:54
c
2:55
which is the hypotenuse
2:58
three squared is nine four squared is
3:00
sixteen
3:01
nine plus sixteen is 25
3:04
and if you take the square root of both
3:06
sides
3:07
you can see that the hypotenuse is 5.
3:10
now it turns out that there are some
3:11
special numbers
3:18
there's the three four five right
3:19
triangle the 5 12 13 right triangle
3:23
the 8 15 17 right triangle
3:26
and the 7 24 25 right triangle
3:31
and any whole number ratios or multiples
3:33
of these numbers will also work for
3:35
example if we multiply this by 2
3:38
we'll get 6 8 10.
3:40
that can also work or
3:43
if you multiply by 3
3:47
you get the 9 12 15 triangle
3:50
if you multiply this one by 2 you get
3:51
the 10
3:52
24 26 triangle
3:55
those are also special triplets
3:59
they work with any right triangle
4:02
now some other numbers that
4:04
are less common but you might see
4:06
are the 9 40 41 triangle and the 1160
4:09
61.
4:13
so if you see some of these numbers you
4:14
can find the missing side quickly
4:16
if you know them
4:18
so now let's finish this problem
4:21
so what is the value of sine theta
4:24
so according to sohcahtoa
4:27
we know that sine theta
4:29
is equal to the opposite side divided by
4:31
the adjacent side
4:32
and the part so
4:35
soh
4:36
opposite to
4:38
theta
4:40
is
4:40
4.
4:42
and hypotenuse is five so therefore sine
4:45
theta
4:46
is going to be four divided by five
4:49
now cosine theta
4:51
is equal to the adjacent side divided by
4:53
the hypotenuse
4:56
we said 4 is the opposite side
4:58
5 is the hypotenuse and 3 is the
5:00
adjacent side so in this case is going
5:02
to be 3 divided by 5.
5:05
so that's the value of cosine
5:08
now let's find the value of tangent
5:11
tangent theta according to toa
5:13
is equal to the opposite side divided by
5:16
the adjacent side
5:17
so that's going to be 4 divided by 3
5:20
so that's the value of tangent
5:23
now once we have these three we can
5:24
easily find the other three
5:26
to find cosecant
5:28
it's one over sine so just flip this
5:30
fraction is going to be five over four
5:33
and secant is the reciprocal of cosine
5:36
so flip this fraction secant is going to
5:38
be five over three
5:40
cotangent is the reciprocal of tangent
5:42
so if cotan i mean if tangent's four
5:45
over three cotangent is going to be
5:47
three over four and that's how you could
5:49
find the value of the six trigonometric
5:51
functions
5:53
let's try another problem
5:58
so let's say this is theta again
6:00
and this side is eight and this side is
6:02
17.
6:03
find the missing side
6:05
and then
6:06
use the completed triangle to find the
6:08
value of the six trigonometric functions
6:10
so go ahead and pause the video and work
6:12
on this problem
6:13
so first we need to know that this is
6:15
the 8 15 17 triangle
6:18
if you ever forget you can fall back to
6:20
this equation
6:23
so a is 8 we're looking for the missing
6:25
side b and the hypotenuse is 17.
6:28
8 squared is 64
6:30
and 17 squared is 289
6:34
289 minus 64 is 225
6:38
and we need to take the square root of
6:39
both sides and the square root of 225 is
6:42
15
6:43
which gives us the missing side of the
6:45
triangle
6:48
so now go ahead and find the value of
6:50
sine theta
6:51
cosine theta
6:53
tangent theta
6:55
and then cosecant theta
6:58
secant theta
6:59
and cotangent theta
7:02
so using sohcahtoa
7:05
we know that sine
7:07
is equal to the opposite side divided by
7:10
the hypotenuse
7:14
so let's label all the three sides 17 is
7:16
the hypotenuse
7:19
8 is the adjacent side
7:21
and opposite to theta is 15.
7:24
so opposite over hypotenuse this is
7:26
going to be 15 divided by 17.
7:29
so that is the value
7:30
of sine theta now cosine theta
7:34
is going to be equal to the adjacent
7:36
side
7:37
divided by the hypotenuse
7:39
so the adjacent side is 8 they have hot
7:42
news is 17. so cosine theta
7:45
is 8 over 17.
7:47
tangent based on toa is going to be
7:50
opposite
7:52
over adjacent
7:54
so opposite is 15 adjacent is 8.
7:57
therefore tangent
7:58
is going to be 15 divided by eight
8:01
now cosecant is the reciprocal of sine
8:04
so if sine theta is 15 over 17 cosecant
8:07
is going to be 17 over 15.
8:11
secant is the reciprocal of cosine so if
8:14
cosine is 8 over 17 secant is 17 over 8.
8:17
you just got to flip it and cotan is a
8:19
reciprocal of tangent
8:21
so cotangent is going to be 8 over 15.
8:24
just flip this fraction
8:26
and now we have the values
8:28
of the six trigonometric functions
8:31
and that's all you gotta do
8:34
so here's a different problem
8:38
so let's say here's our right angle and
8:41
this time this is theta
8:45
and let's say the hypotenuse is 25
8:48
and this side is 15.
8:51
find the missing side and then go ahead
8:52
and find the value of the six
8:54
trigonometric functions
8:57
so this is going to be similar to the
8:58
three four five triangle
9:01
notice that if we multiply everything by
9:03
five
9:04
we'll get two
9:05
of the three numbers that we need three
9:07
times five is fifteen four times five is
9:09
twenty five times five is twenty five
9:13
so we have the fifteen
9:16
and we have the twenty five
9:18
therefore the missing side must be
9:20
twenty
9:24
and you could use the pythagorean
9:25
theorem to confirm this if you want to
9:31
so now let's go ahead and find the value
9:33
of sine theta
9:35
so opposite to theta
9:37
is 20.
9:39
the hypotenuse is always across the box
9:42
it's the longer side
9:43
so 27 is the hypotenuse
9:46
and adjacent to 15 or right next to it
9:49
is 15.
9:51
i mean adjacent to theta is 15.
9:55
now sine theta we know it's opposite
9:57
divided by hypotenuse so it's 20
10:00
over 25
10:02
which reduces to 4 over 5.
10:04
if we divide both numbers by 5. 20
10:06
divided by 5 is 4
10:08
25 divided by 5 is 5.
10:12
cosine theta
10:14
is adjacent over hypotenuse so that's 15
10:16
divided by 25 which reduces to 3 divided
10:19
by 5.
10:21
tangent theta
10:22
is opposite over adjacent
10:25
so 20 over 15
10:27
which
10:28
becomes
10:30
if you divide by 5 that's going to be 4
10:32
over 3.
10:34
now cosecant is the reciprocal of sine
10:37
so it's going to be 5 over 4
10:39
based on
10:41
this value
10:43
and if cosine is 3 over 5
10:47
then secant the reciprocal of cosine has
10:49
to be 5 divided by 3.
10:52
now if tangent
10:54
is 4 over 3 cotangent has to be 3
10:58
divided by 4.
11:00
and so that's it for this problem
11:04
consider the right triangle
11:08
in this right triangle find
11:10
the missing side in this case find the
11:12
value of x let's say the angle is 38
11:15
degrees
11:16
and this side is 42.
11:19
so what trig function
11:21
should you use in order to find the
11:23
value of x
11:24
should we use sine cosine or tangent
11:27
well relative to 38
11:30
we have the opposite side
11:32
which is x
11:34
and the adjacent side
11:36
which is 42.
11:37
so tangent we know it's opposite over
11:39
adjacent so therefore tangent
11:42
of the angle 38 degrees
11:44
is equal to the opposite side x
11:47
divided by the adjacent side 42
11:50
so in order to get x by itself we need
11:51
to multiply both sides by 42.
11:56
so these will cancel
11:57
so therefore x
11:59
is equal to 42
12:01
tangent of 38
12:04
so we need to use the calculator to get
12:06
this answer
12:07
and make sure your calculator is in
12:09
degree mode
12:12
so tan 38
12:14
which is 0.7813
12:19
and let's multiply that by 42
12:22
so this will give you an x value of 32.8
12:31
now let's try another example
12:37
feel free to pause the video to work on
12:38
each of these problems by the way
12:41
so let's say this angle is 54 degrees
12:44
and we're looking for the value of x and
12:47
hypotenuse is 26
12:49
which trig function should we use sine
12:52
cosine of tangent
12:54
so opposite to the right angle we know
12:56
it's the hypotenuse
12:58
and x is on the adjacent side relative
13:01
to 54.
13:03
so cosine
13:04
is associated with adjacent and
13:06
hypotenuse
13:07
so therefore cosine of the angle 54
13:10
is equal to the adjacent side x divided
13:13
by
13:13
the hypotenuse of 26
13:16
so to get x by itself we got to multiply
13:18
both sides by 26
13:22
so therefore x
13:23
is equal to 26
13:26
cosine
13:27
of 54 degrees
13:31
cosine 54
13:32
is 0.587785
13:36
if we multiply that by 26
13:38
this will give us the value of x which
13:40
is 15.28
13:48
here's another one that we could try
13:53
let's say the angle is 32 degrees
13:56
and the hypotenuse is x
13:58
and this is 12.
14:00
so notice that 12 is opposite to
14:04
32
14:06
and we have the hypotenuse so this time
14:08
we need to use the sine function
14:12
sine of the angle 32
14:14
is equal to the opposite side 12
14:16
divided by x
14:20
so in this case what can we do to find
14:22
the value of x
14:27
what would you do
14:30
what i would do is cross multiply
14:32
so 1 times 12
14:35
is 12
14:36
and this is going to equal
14:39
x times sine 32.
14:44
next
14:45
i recommend dividing both sides by sine
14:47
thirty-two
14:51
sine thirty-two divided by itself is one
14:54
so therefore x
14:56
is equal to 12
14:58
over sine 32.
15:02
12 divided by sine 32 is 22.64
15:08
so that's the value of x in this
15:10
particular problem
15:12
now let's work on another problem
15:15
so this time
15:17
we need to find the angle theta
15:20
and we're given these two sides
15:24
so 5 is opposite to the angle
15:28
and 4 is adjacent to it
15:31
so what trig function
15:33
can relate theta 4 and 5
15:36
we know tangent is opposite over
15:38
adjacent so tangent of the angle theta
15:41
is equal to the opposite side which is 5
15:44
divided by the adjacent side 4.
15:47
so how can we find the value of the
15:48
angle theta
15:50
if tangent theta is 5 over 4
15:53
and then theta
15:54
is going to be the inverse tangent or
15:57
arc tangent of 5 over 4 and you simply
16:00
have to type this in your calculator
16:02
so type in
16:04
arc tan 5 over 4
16:07
and you should get an angle
16:09
of
16:10
51.34 degrees
16:13
so that's how you could find the missing
16:14
angle
16:15
let's try another example
16:22
feel free to pause the video and find a
16:23
missing angle
16:25
so in this case we have the adjacent
16:27
side
16:28
and we have the hypotenuse
16:31
so therefore this is associative of
16:33
cosine
16:34
cosine theta is equal to the adjacent
16:36
side
16:37
divided by the hypotenuse so if cosine
16:39
theta is equal to 3 divided by 7
16:42
theta is going to be arc cosine 3 over
16:45
7.
16:48
and once again you have to use a
16:49
calculator to figure this out because
16:51
without a calculator out of you know
16:52
what this answer is
16:54
and this is going to be
16:56
64.62 degrees
17:05
so here's another one for you
17:08
let's say this is 5 and this is 6.
17:12
go ahead and find the value of theta
17:14
so the hypotenuse is 6
17:16
opposites of theta is five
17:19
so we know sine is associated with
17:20
opposite and hypotenuse
17:22
sine theta is equal to the opposite side
17:24
which is five
17:25
divided by the hypotenuse which is six
17:27
therefore theta
17:29
is the arc sine or inverse sine of five
17:32
over six
17:38
and so the angle is going to be
17:40
56.44 degrees
17:43
and that's it that's all you got to do
17:44
to find the missing angle of a right
17:46
triangle

and a circle with a triangle inside the
18:34
circle
18:40
so let's look at the curriculum in the
18:42
first section
18:44
i'm going to go over angles
18:47
radians how to convert degrees to
18:49
radians
18:50
coterminal angles
18:52
how to convert dms to decimal degrees
18:55
arc length
18:56
area of the sector of a circle
18:58
linear speed and angular speed word
19:00
problems and also if you need to take
19:03
the time that's shown on the clock and
19:05
if you need to convert it to an angle
19:07
measure
19:08
i cover that in this section as well
19:10
and then at the end of each section is
19:11
the video quiz
19:13
the next section is about the unit
19:15
circle the six trig functions
19:17
sine cosine tangent secant cosecant
19:20
cotan
19:22
and also reference angles as well
19:24
after that you have right triangle
19:26
trigonometry
19:28
things like sohcahtoa
19:30
the special right triangles like the
19:31
30-60-90 triangle
19:33
you need to know that so you can
19:35
evaluate
19:36
sine and cosine
19:37
functions
19:38
without using the unit circle
19:41
next
19:42
i'm going to talk about how to solve
19:44
angle of elevation and depression
19:46
problems
19:48
and just solving the missing sides of
19:50
right triangles
19:52
after that trigonometric functions of
19:54
any angle
19:56
and then the graph intrigue functions
19:58
you need to know how to graph the sine
19:59
and cosine
20:00
functions secant cosecant
20:03
and tangent as well
20:08
after that
20:09
inverse trig functions you need to know
20:11
how to evaluate it
20:13
and also how to graph it too
20:15
in addition you need to know how to
20:16
graph or evaluate composition of trig
20:19
functions for example we might have
20:21
sine of inverse cosine of 3 over 4 or
20:24
something like that and you can use a
20:26
right triangle
20:27
to solve those types of problems you'll
20:29
see when you
20:31
access that section after that
20:33
applications of trig functions
20:35
solving problems to have two right
20:37
triangles in it
20:39
and
20:40
barons as well
20:42
one of the hardest actions in trig is
20:44
this section verifying trig identities
20:47
so that's uh
20:49
that's a hard one so make sure you spend
20:50
some time
20:51
learning that section after that summer
20:53
difference formulas
20:56
double angle half angle power reducing
20:58
formulas
21:01
product to sum sum to product
21:03
and also solve and trig equations
21:05
but there are still some sections i'm
21:07
going to add to this course like for
21:09
example law of sines law of cosines
21:13
polar coordinates and some other topics
21:15
as well
21:16
so about two-thirds of the course is
21:19
finished so far and for most students
21:21
this is just what they need intrigued
21:23
but in time you'll see more
21:25
so now you know how to access the course
21:26
and if you have any questions let me
21:28
know
21:28
so thanks for watching
21:51
you
