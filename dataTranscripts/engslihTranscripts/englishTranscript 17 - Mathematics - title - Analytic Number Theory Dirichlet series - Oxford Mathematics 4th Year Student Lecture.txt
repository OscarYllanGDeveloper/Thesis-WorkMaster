okay hi everyone so just to recap uh in the last lecture we looked at uh
0:18
multiplicative functions in Du convolution and we established fa of the basic properties of multiplicative
0:25
functions in Du convolution the key principle behind everything being if you
0:30
have a multiplicative function you only need to understand Its Behavior on Prime powers to determine its Behavior
0:36
everywhere and this allows us to sometimes get a handle on some complicated arithmetic functions like
0:42
the mbus function So today we're going to look at a rather different topic we're going to
0:47
look at uh der
0:56
series um and the motivation
1:04
uh for today's lecture is going to come from generating
1:17
functions uh so you've probably seen generating functions in some other context maybe in
1:24
probability um but the basic idea is that uh you can
1:34
understand a lot um
1:40
about a sequence a
1:46
n um if you can
1:54
understand uh the generating function
2:07
which is the sum of a n x^ n so this is a
2:13
function of a variable X um if you can understand this for um all
2:22
complex values of X in a nice region maybe it's absolutely convergent in that region then you can actually recover all
2:28
the terms of the sequence from the uh values of the generating function um
2:34
specializing X just to the unit complex Circle um gives us F series uh and
2:43
there's lots of things like the growth rate of a determines regions of convergence and things for this
2:49
generating function but the basic idea is that if there's a sequence that you're interested in you
2:56
can package it together as a generating function and if you can get handle on the generating function then that can
3:02
tell you a lot about the original sequence um so if you want to adopt this
3:09
kind of mindset with the prime numbers a natural thing to do would be to take
3:14
your a to be maybe the indicator function of the primes and so you would look at the function which is the sum of
3:22
x the^ p summed over all primes P but and if you could understand this
3:28
function the of x the^ p then you'll be able to deduce lots of information about
3:34
the distribution of primes um so in particularly if you could understand um its uh Divergence
3:43
properties uh when X is close to one this would be a potential way of trying to prove the prime number
3:49
theorem now unfortunately this whole potential line of attack fails because
3:55
we have no real ways of getting a handle on the sum of X the power p
4:06
um um
4:21
uh so although properties of this function would incude lots of things about the distribution of primes uh the
4:28
only way we're able to prove anything about this function is to First prove a result about the distribution of primes
4:33
then reduce it for the generating function which is the wrong direction um and maybe morally the
4:40
reason is that um you need some nice structure in the generating function for
4:46
the generating function to be easier than the original sequence and uh the
4:51
primes are somehow multiplicative objects and these generating functions are very additive and so uh it doesn't
4:57
introduce any nice structure in the generator function however you can look at slightly different generating functions
5:04
and these are called der series and this turns out to be a much more profitable way of trying to understand the sequence
5:12
so instead um we can work with more
5:26
arithmetic uh generating functions
5:34
uh and in particular instead of looking at the sum of a n x^ n you can look at the sum of a
5:44
n * n^ s or n^ minus
5:49
s and the same basic philosophy works that if you can understand uh things
5:57
about this function then you can understand understand a lot about your underlying sequence uh but it turns out
6:03
that uh in this formulation it's more amable to uh things like
6:09
multiplication uh it's a slightly more arithmetic way of doing the generating function and so it turns out that we can
6:15
get some understanding on these sums without a prior having understanding on
6:21
the underlying sequence so that's the motivation for introducing these disle series um so
6:28
let's think about sequence of this type so maybe a first uh basic thing is that
6:35
we like to think of this as a function of the variable s and in particular we' like to think of it as a um complex
6:42
valued uh function so complex values of s and we need to know that this infinite
6:48
sum even makes sense as a complex function
6:53
so uh a basic LMA let f
7:00
go from the positive integers to the complex
7:05
numbers satisfy the size of f of n is bounded above by n the power
7:13
little1 so that just means that um when n is larger large enough F of n is less
7:20
than n the^ 1 over 100 and if N is a bit larger still then f ofn is always less
7:26
than n^ one over million and so on
7:32
then the dually series I'll call it capital F of s which is the sum n = 1 to
7:41
Infinity F of n/ n the S um converges
7:52
absolutely um to an analytic
7:58
function um for the real part of s being strictly
8:06
bigger than one and it
8:12
converges uniformly
8:20
absolutely for the real part of s being big than equal to 1 plus Delta fly
8:28
fixed
8:35
and so this is basically saying that uh we can view this as a complex fun and
8:41
analytic function of the variable s and this makes sense whenever the real part of s is bigger than
8:48
one so let's just prove this I got to it under me proof's quite
8:56
short um so uh if we recall what all this converging
9:03
absolutely means uh it just means that we want
9:09
the uh partial sums to converge to F of
9:14
s uh with a eror term where we put in absolute values always being small so in
9:19
particular we want to show that the sum of f of n Over N the S with absolute
9:26
values on the inside for n between N1 and
9:31
N2 we want to show that this tends to zero as N1 and N2 tend to
9:39
Infinity um okay so we just need to bounce this sum
9:48
and uh we know that F of n is bounded above by n the
9:53
little1 so let's think of the real part of s being at least 1 plus Delta and
9:59
since F of n is bound above by n the little1 uh F of n is uh certainly
10:06
smaller than some constant time n Delta / 2 so this is bounded above by some
10:15
constant times n Delta 2 that's our Bound for f of N and if the real part of
10:23
s so the absolute value of 1/ n the S is 1 / n to the real part of of s if the
10:30
real part of s is at least 1 plus Delta this is bounded by 1/ n 1 plus
10:40
Delta so this is since F of n is bounded above by n the
10:49
Delta 2
10:55
and and we're assuming that the real part of s is at least 1 plus
11:02
Delta and this is now a uh sum that we can work out we could maybe do an
11:09
integral comparison to say that this is bounded above by the integral between N1
11:15
- one and 2 of DT maybe this going to be a constant DT
11:23
over T 1 + Delta 2 just because uh n the
11:30
Delta over 2 / n 1 plus Delta is 1 over n 1 plus Delta over 2 and that's bounded
11:38
above by the integral between nus1 and N of 1/ T 1 plus Delta over
11:46
two and so then adding all of those up gives this integral so that's just the integral comparison and then this is
11:54
bounded above by some constant over Delta time maybe
11:59
N1 -1 to the Delta / 2 and the key point is that here within
12:06
of Delta ISM fixed small number and so as N1 tends to Infinity this is tending
12:13
to
12:21
zero um and uh this rate of convergence is uh
12:29
independent of what s is in this region uh so
12:34
therefore this means that we have uh
12:42
uniform absolute
12:47
convergence on the real part of s being equal to 1 plus Delta for any
12:58
fixed positive Delta and if we have this for every fixed positive Delta that
13:03
certainly means we have uh absolute convergence whenever the real part is strictly bigger than
13:12
one so this is just basic complex analysis now that uh since the partial
13:18
sums are analytic this means that the limit function is analytic we're
13:25
done okay so that works for any function F or any sequence um which doesn't grow
13:32
too quickly but maybe the most important example is the function which I
13:40
mentioned in the very first lecture which is the ran zeta
13:56
function um
14:05
so this is written as C of s and it's just what we get when we take uh the
14:11
function f to be identically equal to
14:24
one so we know that this is some complex analytic function in this
14:31
region um now the first so the r function will be
14:39
absolutely play a central role in this course and uh there are several very
14:46
important and special properties that the r zeta function satisfies and the
14:51
first one that we're going to prove today is that although initially this definition only makes sense when the
14:58
real part of s is is bigger than one and if the real part of s was smaller
15:03
then uh this series here would not be converging nicely um nevertheless we can
15:10
uh use analytic continuation to uh make sense for the r to function in a much
15:16
wider range um so
15:25
uh so maybe this is the first
15:32
keyma we're going to you we're going to prove analytic
15:42
continuation of Z2
15:47
s and so this says uh maybe for the real
15:56
part of s being bigger than minus 2 we have another formula for zet s zet
16:06
s is 1 / s - 1 + a half + s/ 12 - s * s + 1 * s + 2 *
16:18
the integral from 1 to Infinity of the fractional part of t - 3 * the
16:25
fractional part of T ^2+ 2 * the fractional part of T
16:32
cubed all over 12 t^ s + 3
16:43
DT um where here the fra T in Kelly
16:50
brackets is the fractional part of T so it's T minus the largest integer Which
16:56
is less than equal to T
17:02
okay so um just to recap what analytic continuation and things means uh we have
17:10
this one definition that makes sense in this region and this is a completely
17:15
separate definition but this definition uh converges in this region and it
17:22
matches exactly that definition when the real part of s is bigger than one uh
17:29
we have to be careful that this has a simple poll at s equals 1 uh but this
17:38
is is similar to
17:44
um uh the
17:52
continuation of the sum of z the^
17:57
n by the
18:03
expression uh 1/ 1 - Z so this power series only
18:11
converges when the absolute value of Zed is less than one but when it is less than one it is
18:19
exactly equal to 1 over 1 - Ed maybe I should start at zero
18:25
um uh but this expression actually makes in the entire complex plane with a simple pole at zal
18:32
1 and so here we have the same sort of situation we have a serious expansion
18:37
that makes sense in one region and then we have another definition that makes sense in a wider
18:44
region and so let's prove this analytic continuation and then we can have a
18:51
little bit of a think about what it means and the key to the proof will just be to use partial
18:57
summation so apply partial
19:08
summation with a n being equal to one and F ofn
19:16
being or maybe F of T being T the minus
19:22
s um so here a of t which is the sum of a
19:30
of n for n up to T will just
19:35
be the largest integer less and equal to
19:42
T um so what does that give we have the sum from n = 1 to Infinity of 1 / n
19:51
s uh well we would get uh one term which
19:57
is uh uh well we can use our LMA that we
20:04
had when we were proving partial summation which would have minus s * the
20:09
integral from 1 to Infinity of a of T which is the FL function of T um
20:18
times uh there'll be the derivative of s which is - s * t s - 1 T the S +
20:26
1 DT and so we'll get this from our partial simulation
20:32
LMA there's uh no one term or infinite term
20:39
because uh a of one is equal to zero and a of t f of T tends to zero when the
20:48
real part of s is bigger than one so we're
20:55
temporarily imagining that the real part of s is bigger than one so that this left hand side makes sense
21:02
but I can write the floor function of t
21:07
as T minus the fractional part of
21:25
T and we can now do this integral this is just the integral of 1/ TS and this
21:31
gives us an s/ S -1 minus the integral
21:37
from s * the integral from 1 to Infinity of the fractional part of T DT over t to
21:44
the S + one and the key observation here is that
21:53
this s over s minus one is a an IC
21:59
function in the entire complex plane apart from it has a simple pole at s equals
22:05
1 this integral here using essentially the same argument
22:11
here uh is converges absolutely whenever this
22:18
integral converges the integral is the numerator in the integral is always bounded by one and the denominator is
22:26
bounded by T ^ 1+ the real part of s and so this integral converges when the real
22:32
part of s is bigger than zero which means that this actually converts to an antic function whenever the real part of
22:38
s is bigger than zero and so this whole expression here not only makes sense
22:44
when the real part of s is bigger than one but this also makes sense when the real part of s is bigger than
22:57
zero
23:11
okay so we wanted to get this more complicated formula um which held
23:17
whenever the real part of s is bigger than minus 2 and to do that we're just going to do integration by
23:27
parts um so we see that the integral from one
23:36
to Infinity of the fractional part of T over t s + 1
23:43
DT well this is equal to um a half minus
23:49
s * the integral from 1 to Infinity of the functional part of T minus a half
23:57
over t T the S +1
24:02
DT and then I can use integration by parts
24:07
to say this is uh minus a half - s * s + 1 times the
24:15
integral between one and Infinity of well I'm going to get
24:21
a I've got a I'm differentiating differentiating 1 over T to s+ one which
24:27
gives me a um minus s +1 over T s+1 and
24:34
then I want to integrate uh the fractional part of T minus a half so that will give me
24:41
AG G of T DT where G of T is equal to the integral
24:49
between 1 and T of maybe the fractional part of U minus a half
24:57
du
25:02
but uh you may have wondered why I've taken off this one half well the point
25:09
is that if I look at the uh this function fractional part of U
25:17
-2 and I draw the graph it starts at -
25:24
one2 and it then has a sort of to
25:30
shape centered about zero and the integral over any interval
25:36
of length one is equal to zero so we see
25:43
that g of T is equal to
25:49
um G of t + 1 full T
25:54
um since the integral
26:00
of the fractional part of U minus a half over any
26:07
interval of length one is zero so the one the minus one2 is
26:14
taken off this main term contribution to have this property and so in
26:21
particular G of T is equal to G of the fractional part of t
26:29
uh I guess I can change the definition to the integral between Zer and T because that doesn't change anything and
26:36
then this would be equal to the integral from not to the fractional part of T
26:43
of uus a half
26:48
du since the fractional part of U is just going to be equal to U whenever U's between 0 and
26:55
one and then this will be equal to the fractional part of t^2
27:01
minus the fractional part of T all over
27:11
2 so I can substitute that in and I get that we get that this
27:16
is our overall integral is 12 minus s *
27:23
s + 1 * the integral from 1 to Infinity of the fraction part of t^ 2 minus the
27:30
fractional part of T all over 2 / 2 to the S + 2
27:37
DT and the nice thing here is that this now makes sense as a uh complex analytic
27:44
function whenever the real part of s is bigger than minus one so before we started off only making
27:50
sense when the real part of s is bigger than one then we did a partial summation and it made sense when the real part of
27:55
s is Big than zero now it's making sense when everything real part of s is bigger than minus one and we can keep on going
28:02
uh you can do this as many steps as you want but maybe I'll just do it one more step to get the statement of the
28:10
LMA so
28:16
um apply integration by parts
28:26
again so again again you want to take off uh the main
28:33
term here and I think that's 1 16 and you get that
28:39
this is equal to 12+ s over 12 - s * s + 1 * s + 2 the
28:50
integral from 1 to Infinity of the fractional part of T minus 3 time
28:58
the fractional part of T ^2+ 2 * the fractional part of T cubed all over 12 t
29:07
to the S + 3
29:18
DT
29:27
um so
29:34
um yeah that doesn't matter at all because it's a null set this really
29:40
doesn't affect anything um at all uh yeah and also when we apply an
29:47
integration by parts we don't we're only integrating this G function we're never
29:53
differentiating it um so in fact you know G only needs to be continuous or
30:03
something yeah are there any other questions about
30:12
this okay so later on in the course we'll um prove analytic continuation in
30:18
a rather different way uh it's uh the two different ways of proof analytic
30:24
continuation are each useful and each provide their own insights into the
30:30
properties of the ran Z function uh but the thing that I'd maybe like to uh
30:36
emphasize is that this is a special
30:56
property um so if I took
31:04
a uh generic function f or sequence uh a n instead of just the function one uh
31:12
then I wouldn't have analytic continuation in this way to the entire complex plane so this is something uh
31:18
this is uh exploiting the fact that the integers are rigid and somewhat
31:26
algebraic under addition is what's going on under here and this is a special
31:31
property that's special to the Rema function so other dly series do have
31:37
analytic continuation but when you have an analytic continuation that means that you're exploiting some sort of uh
31:43
special properties of the sequence and certainly analytic continuation to the entire complex plane
31:49
is exploiting a certain rigidity of the integers under
31:56
addition so although the that the ran zeta function initially made sense
32:01
whenever the real part is bigger than one holds for completely arbitrary D series that uh where the coefficients
32:07
don't grow too quickly uh we're now using something sort of more important
32:12
about uh the integers in this context
32:20
okay um so this analytic continuation allows us to define the function Z verse
32:27
in a wider region and we can just immediately then see a few properties of
32:35
this so one cery is that if we're
32:41
thinking about a the r zeta function evaluated at a
32:47
real point if the real point is between Z and one
32:53
then Z of X will be negative whereas if X is bigger than
33:02
one then Z of X will be
33:07
positive and the proof of this is essentially
33:13
immediate um that uh z s is equal to s/ S -1 minus s
33:23
* the integral from 1 to Infinity of the fractional part of t over t to the s+1
33:31
DT from the previous
33:37
proof and here then both terms are negative if s is a real number between
33:44
zero and
33:56
one uh similarly when X is bigger than one uh
34:04
you can just use the standard definition of the Reed function because the real part is bigger than
34:13
one and this is just the sum of positive terms and so it's always going to give you some value which is bigger than
34:26
one um another quity is that we can understand something about some special
34:32
values of the r function uh so in particular the value of the zeta
34:39
function at minus1 is equal to -12th
34:45
so uh you may have heard um about the story of we're managing writing to Hardy
34:53
and amongst uh uh managing uh various letters that he sent he uh
35:01
wrote the somewhat Fantastical formula that 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 and so on is equal to
35:12
- 12th um and obviously using standard mathematics
35:20
this doesn't make sense this is a obviously Divergent series um but uh
35:26
what the manager was trying to say was precisely the fact that the rean ca
35:32
function evaluated at minus1 is equal to -12th so the minus one 12th is here and
35:39
the 1+ 2+ 3+ 4 would be what you would get if you substitute minus one into the
35:45
standard definition that only makes sense when the real part of s is bigger than one uh you'd have the sum over 1 / n
35:53
the^ minus one which is just the sum of N so this
36:01
is ranagen Divergent
36:10
sum okay but the proof of this is also basically just immediate we can
36:17
substitute um minus one into uh maybe
36:23
our expression here
36:30
uh so we can
36:38
substitute into the expression of
36:48
our so when we substitute s is equal to
36:54
minus1 it's certainly bigger than min-2 so we can use this formula uh the minus
37:00
one will kill off this Factor here so this whole integral term disappears and we'll just get -2 + 12 + -1
37:10
over2 so Zeta of -1 is equal to - 12 +
37:17
12 + - 12th + 0 which is equal to -
37:26
12th um so one very useful thing about this
37:33
expression uh that we'll make use of in the course is that uh not only does it
37:38
give a natural extension to the definition of the M zeta function it also quite quickly gives some reasonable
37:46
bounds on the growth of the zeta function um in this wider
37:51
region and uh the size of of uh generating
37:59
functions is always a very important thing to control if you want to understand the underlying sequence so I will record this as a
38:09
Lama another useful consequence of our analytic continuation and this is the
38:17
growth of Z of s so for the real part of s being bigger
38:26
than minus uh 29 over
38:33
10 I want 29
38:40
10 that looks like a
38:46
typo let me just I think I've got a typo in my notes
38:55
apologies uh yeah - 19 / 10 so we're in
39:01
the region where that formula makes sense because the real part of s is bigger than
39:06
-2 and S -1 being biger than equal to
39:14
1 we have that the size of Z of s is bounded above
39:22
by 1 plus the size of s cubed and so in particular it's having polinomial type
39:28
growth um if we're thinking of s as being having real part maybe of size
39:36
betweenus 1.9 and 1.9 but potentially having a very large imaginary
39:45
part and uh the proof of this is again pretty immediate from this
39:53
Lemma uh we just want to bound the size of z s so we can bound the size of each
39:59
term so we have 1 over s + 1 but if 1 /
40:06
s minus one but if s- one is bigger than one that's bounded above by Big O of
40:11
one2 is bounded above by Big O of one uh the absolute the size of s over2
40:21
is bounded by the size of s and the
40:28
uh integral is absolutely convergent and so is bounded by bigger of one and so we
40:34
just have this product s * s + 1 * s + 2 which is bounded above
40:41
by 1 + S cubed and this in turn is bounded of by
40:50
1 + S cubed um all of these you if
40:56
the absolute value of s is bigger than 10 then this is uh bounded but this is
41:02
bigger of s cubed whereas if the absolute value of s is less than 10
41:08
that's certainly bigger of one so we get a 1 plus s Cub
41:24
here uh uh yes in this region that
41:30
essentially this is uh the continuous analog of exactly what we did here we
41:37
just need to show that uh the tales of the integral converge uh absolutely the
41:44
numerator is always of size bigger of one and when the real part of s is say
41:52
bigger than uh -2 plus Delta uh this
41:58
is bounded if I'm looking at the integral between capital n and infinity this will be bounded in exactly the same
42:04
way here as 1 over n the^ Delta and so 10 to zero as we look at the
42:10
Tails um so yeah by exactly the same argument there this integral is um
42:17
uniformly convergent and therefore imp analytic for the real part of as minus
42:26
2 is
42:31
sorry uh there isn't a reason that we stopped at two uh we could keep on going further and further in fact there's a
42:38
question on the exercise sheet uh precisely about this um the formul
42:43
actually this is a slightly messy way of proven analytic continuation and so there's going to be a much neater way of
42:49
proven full analytic continuation later on in the course um however I wanted to
42:55
go this far both so that we got uh suitable growth estimates that will be
43:01
useful later on in the course and it's easier to prove these growth estimates using this estimate but we only need
43:06
them in a restricted re region going up to minus two um and also I wanted to show this REM managing uh Divergent
43:14
series estimate uh which requires us to go slightly Beyond minus one so uh it's
43:21
many with further applications in mind that I went as far as minus two um but
43:27
we could go further and we could keep on doing this and we get more and more messy formula but they would uh look
43:33
precisely of this shape given some uh serious expansion in terms of s with a
43:39
bigger and bigger product here and some polinomial in the fractional part of T in the numerator and then uh the
43:46
denominator of this integral will be something like t^ S Plus
43:54
K was there another question no okay great
44:01
um Okay so we've shown that the rean ca function even if we evaluate it at um
44:08
points with potentially very large imaginary part can't be too big it only
44:13
has this polinomial growth which I mentioned will be a useful input later
44:19
on um [Applause] maybe uh for the last few bits of the Le
44:27
I just want to um prove a couple of other estimates now
44:35
about the Reta function so maybe another LMA we can look at the derivative of the
44:42
r function so for the real part of s
44:48
bigger than one we have that the derivative of the V
44:55
function is = to minus the sum from n = 1 to Infinity
45:04
of log n Over N the S so this is maybe exactly what you would expect that we
45:12
know that in this region the zeta function is given by 1 over n to the S and if I differentiate one the sum of 1
45:18
over n the S and if I differentiate 1 over n the S with respect to S I get minus log n Over N the S but I have to
45:25
be a bit careful about the order convergence
45:31
um so I have to be a little bit careful with the proof um so let the real part of s be
45:41
equal to 1+ Delta um by
45:47
the maximum modulus
45:55
principle we have that the largest value for
46:02
Zed of size itus 1/ Delta / 2
46:07
of 1/ Z *
46:13
1/ n^ S Plus Z - 1 over n^ of s is equal
46:21
to uh the this supremum is occurs on the
46:27
boundary of the dis this is just because uh 1 / Z * 1/ n^ S Plus Z and 1 / Z * 1/
46:37
n^ s are both analytic functions of
46:51
Z and now since we have that Z is of size Delta over 2 I can give an upper bound
46:58
of this is quite easily 1 / Z is bounded by 2 over
47:05
Delta and 1/ n^ s+
47:11
Z is bounded by 1/ n^ 1 + Delta / 2 since the real part
47:19
of s is uh 1 plus Delta and similarly 1/ n the^ s is
47:26
bounded above by certainly 1 over n^ 1 plus
47:41
Delta and the key Point here that since the exponent on N is bigger than one this is now absolutely
47:47
summable and
47:53
so uh Z primed of s which is equal to
47:58
the Limit as Z TS to zero of Z of s + z
48:05
minus Z of s over
48:11
Zed is equal to the Limit as Z tends to
48:18
zero the limit as n TS to Infinity of
48:23
the sum the partial sums from Little n = 1 to capital N of 1/ Z
48:31
* 1/ n s + z - one over
48:39
NS but since uh this is absolutely summable uh
48:45
we can swap the order of the
48:55
limits
49:16
and therefore we get that this is the limit as n tends to Infinity the limit
49:22
is z TS to zero of some n = 1 to n of 1
49:30
/ z 1/ n s plus Z - 1/ n s and then this is
49:38
just our termwise differentiation
49:55
answer so we needed to be careful that we couldn't that we could justify this
50:00
swap in the order of limits and all that meant was that we had to make sure that when we were looking at uh the tals with
50:08
very large values of n uh they had a bounding contribution that was bounded just in terms of capital n and that
50:14
follows from this estimate
50:23
[Applause] here um okay on I'm almost out of
50:29
time we've proven one of the Key properties of the Z function uh there's maybe one final Lemma that will
50:40
prove useful for later on in the course which is an approximate
50:51
formula for C of s and this says that
51:00
um C2 of s is equal to the sum from n =
51:05
1 to n of 1/ n s + n^ 1 - s over s - one plus
51:15
Big O of s n minus real part of s uh
51:25
maybe uh for for the real part of s maybe I'll start off
51:33
with big
51:40
one so the proof of this well we have that Z of s is equal to the sum n = 1 to
51:49
n of 1 over n s plus the sum from n = n
51:54
+1 to Infinity of 1 over n the
51:59
S and then uh
52:05
so maybe I'll be a little bit more careful I want the conclusion to hold full values of rule part of s bigger
52:12
than zero but I'm going to first of all work with real prod of s biger than
52:25
one so I can do exactly the same partial summation argument as I did to prove
52:32
analytic continuation but rather than starting at uh one I can start at
52:38
capital N plus one for any choice of capital n and what I
52:44
get is essentially exactly the same thing where I replace my T's by T minus
52:50
n's in the denominator
53:15
so by partial summation again um I get that uh the sums of 1/ n the S
53:25
is equal to to Capital a of T times the derivative of f of T the derivative of f
53:33
of T is - s * t to the - s -1 and when
53:39
I'm just looking at the sequence that starts at n plus 1 instead of having the floor function of T I'll have the floor
53:45
function of T minus n but again I can separate out the main
53:51
term and this uh Big O one part of the integral
54:00
the integral of tus n/ t s + one between
54:06
uh n and infinity just gives a n 1 - s
54:11
over s - one we can just calculate that integral and then I get an integral
54:18
between n and Infinity of well the fractional part of T minus n is equal to
54:23
the fractional part of t for any integer n
54:31
and then this inal this integral now certainly makes sense whenever the real part of s is
54:37
bigger than
54:44
zero so this is an alternative analytic continuation of the room zeta function
54:49
where we now have this integer parameter capital N that we can choose
54:55
and we see that the integral from s of s
55:01
* uh the integral from capital N to Infinity of the fractional part of T
55:06
over t^ s +1 DT is then bounded above by the absolute
55:14
value of s times the integral from n to Infinity of DT over t^ 1
55:24
+ the real part of s whenever the real part of s is bigger than zero which in
55:30
turn is bounded by S * n the
55:36
minus real part of s
55:42
which gives us precisely the approximate formula that we had here so this is again using our partial
55:51
summation argument that we use to prove analytic continuation to get this approximate formula
55:57
um which is valid in our wider region and this turns out to be very useful
56:02
that we can even when the full series diverges and doesn't make sense we can
56:08
still uh approximate the zeta function pretty well by the uh partial sums of
56:15
the original series okay I think I'm out of time so I I'll maybe stop here thanks a lot for
56:25
listening
56:37
