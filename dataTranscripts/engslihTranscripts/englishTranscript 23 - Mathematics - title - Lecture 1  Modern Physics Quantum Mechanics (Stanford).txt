i just want to do one thing actually before we start the uh the material of the class a whole bunch
0:22
of people a lot of people particularly people from europe who actually follow these things on the internet seem
0:28
very puzzled they send me email even some of my friends in europe who are physicists who are following it
0:34
uh are very curious about what's going on here they don't see you people they only see me and they know that i'm teaching a
0:42
class in this or that special uh special topic
0:47
in classical mechanics or whatever and they can sense that there's something a little bit different about it
0:53
they can sense that it's not a standard undergraduate or graduate course in
1:00
these subjects and they ask me what is this what is this about or who are these people you're teaching
1:05
to they can tell it and most of them don't know what continuing education means
1:12
they didn't know what it meant and so they asked me i thought i would tell them over the uh
1:19
over the internet what this class is it's continuing education which means
1:25
education for people not from stanford people not oh they can be from stanford some of the
1:32
people probably are either employed by stanford maybe were students at stanford
1:39
but um almost everybody in this class is a little bit too old to be an
1:44
undergraduate student even a little bit too old to be a graduate student they're people from the
1:51
community from palo alto from mountain view from uh who lives further than mountain view
1:58
okay what's the furthest there you come for this where foster city okay so that's 20
2:05
miles away so people from within a certain radius i don't know whatever the radius is
2:11
are allowed to come and take courses at stanford they pay a bit of money for it and a professor teaches them now this is
2:18
not it is most definitely not your standard freshman physics
2:24
there's another guy on the internet who teaches freshman physics i'm told he does it very well that's not
2:30
what this is this is the real mccoy theoretical physics at the full scale level
2:38
we use equations we not only use equations we sometimes use hard equations but we
2:44
tend to try to use the simplest equations that will do the job
2:52
basically we try to keep it minimal uh just out of curiosity i i more or
2:59
less know the answer just by looking but what the age distribution of people here is by comparing is there anybody
3:07
here under 40 yeah there's uh there's maybe one
3:12
handful of people under 40 incidentally for those who can't see the audience there's probably
3:18
about 100 people in the room i'm not sure it's a it's a small theater uh
3:23
with a lot of seats it's uh a lecture theater more or less filled up
3:30
and um maybe four or five or three or four people were under 40.
3:37
let's see let's go to the other end how many people here are over 70
3:42
a good deal more maybe uh 10 or 12. anybody over 80 i got a couple of people over 80.
3:49
anybody over 90 this time oh there have been people over 90 they're having people over 90 in this
3:56
class so you see the age distribution is such that basically people
4:02
want to get to the basic ideas fast they don't have a hell of a lot of time
4:11
they want to get there fast so i try to tell them in some
4:18
minimal way what the basic things you really have to know in order to get on to the next thing
4:24
sometimes the basic things that you need to know are a little more difficult a little more elaborate
4:30
we do them anyway we do them as efficiently and as straightforwardly and with the minimal amount of stuff
4:36
uh to get them right to get them really right not metaphor not the not the analogy but equations
4:44
when necessary what else can i say about this class
4:52
i guess it has various names quantum mechanics the physics 25. i'm inclined to call it
4:58
quantum mechanics for old people including myself
5:11
anyway the first course in the series let me just uh say what the outline of the whole
5:18
course of courses is these series of courses will consist of
5:23
about six ten lecture series
5:28
the first of which was in classical mechanics the classical mechanics is the basic
5:34
basis of all classical physics classical means before quantum mechanics anything
5:41
that doesn't involve quantum mechanics or which ignores quantum mechanics or
5:47
which is in a range of parameters where quantum mechanics can be replaced
5:54
by basic classical logic that's called classical physics
6:00
so the first class was classical mechanics which is in some sense the basis for all
6:06
of physics the motion of objects the energy of objects the momentum of objects
6:12
what the characteristic behavior of systems is as they evolve with time
6:19
and so forth we discussed that last quarter and anybody who is thinking of following
6:25
these classes should begin with that the next class which is already on the internet
6:33
was called i believe quantum entanglement now this is also a class on quantum
6:39
mechanics and it will be self-contained but i would strongly advise anybody
6:44
who's following to go to course number two was it called
6:50
quantum entanglement does anybody remember i think it was called quantum entanglement it is also on the internet
6:55
it was the first one that was on the internet and uh to get that under your belt first
7:02
before attempting to do the full-scale quantum mechanics that we're going to do here although what i'm going to do is pretty
7:09
self-contained i'm going to start with this evening
7:15
with some basic thoughts about the deep differences in the logic
7:24
of classical mechanics and quantum mechanics or classical maybe even mechanics is too
7:32
strong a word classical physics and quantum mecha and quantum physics
7:38
there are some very queer phenomena in quantum physics that don't exist in classical physics
7:44
now one of them is the fact that quantum mechanics is based on statistical
7:51
thinking randomness a certain degree of um not imprecision that's not the
7:57
right word a certain degree of uh non-deterministic or indeterministic
8:04
behavior unpredictability that's the word i'm looking for unpredictability
8:09
but it's a special kind of unpredictability einstein famously said god does not play
8:16
dice niels bohr told him einstein don't tell god what to do
8:24
but in fact in a sense god i don't know if there's a god when i i use the word god in the same uh
8:30
sense that physicists always use it meaning uh the laws of physics or something like
8:35
that the laws of physics don't play dice at least not in the standard sense
8:40
let me imagine for you a theory that's based on a bit of statistics which is not the way quantum mechanics
8:48
works and then i'll illustrate it for you by showing you some of the differences
8:53
imagine that there was a element of randomness in newton's law
9:01
whatever which law f equals m a together with the law of um of gravity all right so
9:08
f equals m8 together with the law of gravity tells us how objects move let us say how the moon
9:15
moves around the earth and it predicts with infinite precision if you could work out the equations with infinite
9:21
precision and if you could account for every detail of the earth and the moon and all
9:28
the material that's in between and so forth it would predict with enormous detail
9:37
deterministically the motion of the moon which means if you know where the moon starts and you know how the moon is moving in
9:43
the beginning then you can predict forever after exactly how the moon moves around the earth
9:48
that's the deterministic classical mechanics now let me imagine a modification and
9:54
the modification involves a little bit of randomness for example okay so let's imagine
10:02
god sitting on his throne throwing dice every tenth of a second god throws the
10:08
dye and if he gets snake eyes what he does is he gives the moon a little extra push
10:15
in one direction if he gets a seven he pushes the moon
10:20
a little bit in the other direction a degree of randomness based on the random throwing of dyson
10:28
really random a really random number generator uh being used to put a little bit of
10:35
fluctuation into the motion of the moon that sounds like it introduces the kind
10:42
of uncertainty the kind of thing that one talks about in quantum mechanics uncertainty
10:49
um non-predictability unpredictability
10:55
but it is not anything like the randomness and unpredictability of quantum mechanics the randomness and
11:02
unpredictability of quantum mechanics is exceedingly special exceedingly special and quite different
11:09
and it's that that we want to get our head around and learn and understand the difference between these things
11:16
by the time this class is finished but also we want to learn how to use quantum mechanics a little bit to calculate some
11:22
things let's notice one thing about this
11:28
law which includes a little bit of randomness the throwing of dice in order to uh to
11:33
either kick the moon a little bit or inhibit the moon's motion a little bit one of the things that would do
11:41
is to add a little bit of energy or subtract a little bit of energy from the motion of the moon
11:46
randomly if you randomly give the moon a knock this way and then a kick that way and a bunk that way
11:53
and keep doing it over and over again each time you do it this on the average it may not change the
12:00
energy but each little increment is randomly going to either increase the energy or
12:06
decrease the energy of the moon and if you do that randomly eventually
12:11
that will build up to a statistical randomness in the energy in other words energy would not be
12:18
exactly conserved in a world in which the laws of motion
12:23
included a little bit of classical randomness i call it classical
12:29
randomness to distinguish it from quantum randomness
12:34
in quantum mechanics you prepare a system the same way that you might prepare the
12:41
moon in an initial situation you let it go for a while and then you look at it
12:46
and indeed you discover at the end of it that what you measure is a little bit
12:53
unpredictable but you also find that energy is exactly
12:59
conserved no hint no remnant at all
13:04
of energy being knocked this way and not that way if you start it with a given energy with
13:10
a given precise energy and you let it evolve for a while and you measure the energy later
13:16
the energy is exactly the same as you started with so there's something funny about this
13:21
randomness it seems to affect some things and not other things and doesn't work the way you might expect uh
13:28
randomness and classical physics to work let me give you two oh i think three other examples of
13:35
the oddness of this randomness the first comes from an experiment which
13:42
to my mind shows the weirdness of quantum mechanics in the easiest
13:47
and most straightforward least difficult way much easier for my money than bell's
13:52
inequalities and all that sort of stuff it's called a two-slit experiment all of you know about it or most of you know
13:58
about it if not you learn about it right now but it is extremely odd when compared
14:03
with classical uh randomness right so classical randomness just being this
14:10
idea that every now and then you give the system a little knock the two-slit experiment involves a
14:15
source of particles those particles could be photons they could be electrons
14:20
they could be neutrons they could be bowling balls except the effect for bowling balls is
14:26
so minute that you'd never be able to measure it so when we speak about particles we
14:31
think about things which are very light and because they're light the quantum effects associated with them
14:37
are significant and measurable all right so we have a source of some kind it could be a laser
14:42
shooting out photons but imagine the photons are coming through one at a time very small number of them
14:50
uh quanta of light one at a time one at a time one every five minutes if you like i
14:56
don't know just to go to some extreme situation these are the photons coming out of the photon gun
15:03
and the photons pass through a obstacle with a little hole in it all
15:10
right this is a two dimensional diagram of a three-dimensional situation this
15:15
blue object over here is intended to be a disc with a tiny hole in it
15:23
so the photons can go through and they come out the other side of the
15:29
hole and when they come out the other side of the hole they eventually get to a screen over here
15:34
that screen records the photon by a flash a flash of light at the
15:40
screen not the flash of the original photons but another flash of energy appears at a
15:47
point on the screen and records or it could be just the blackening of a photographic
15:53
a photographic plate something that records the position of the photon
15:58
when it goes through here now first let's think classically uh
16:04
but classically with a bit of randomness the bit of randomness that we can
16:09
imagine is that when the photon goes through here
16:14
a little random kick might influence the photon and either kick it upwards or downwards
16:22
in fact by a random amount what would we expect then well if there was no randomness then the
16:28
photons would go straight through and illuminate a single point be completely deterministic the photons
16:35
would always arrive at exactly the same point if the hole was small enough and if the beam of photons was narrow
16:42
enough but now we can imagine a random kick what does the random kick do
16:48
well it changes the direction of the photon of the photon not the whole photon beam but one photon at a time
16:55
it might kick the first photon up a little bit the second photon down and so forth and so on eventually
17:02
what you will see is a blob of illumination
17:09
on the screen over here on the average the photon might go straight ahead
17:14
so the blob might be most intense at the center it might be highly improbable
17:21
to knock the photon through uh 60 or 70 degrees so the signal would
17:27
fade as you moved away from the center you would see a blob with a maximum
17:33
intensity near the center and thinning out as you move far away
17:38
and you might describe it by a probability function the probability function being the
17:44
probability that the photon arrives in different places okay now we go oh now we do the same
17:51
thing in real quantum mechanics in other words in the real world we see essentially the same thing the
17:58
photons go through the hole with no ability to control the situation
18:05
we find out that the photons again create a blob like this but now we're going to do something a
18:11
little different and i think everybody here more or less more or less everybody knows what i'm going to do
18:18
i'm going to open a second hole okay but let's think about what
18:24
classical randomness would do classical randomness would simply mean
18:29
that we and we'll also imagine that this beam of photons
18:35
is at its origin a little bit uncertain and a little bit random so
18:41
that some photons begin a little bit upward some photons a little bit downward
18:47
some photons go through the upper hole some photons go through the lower hole
18:54
if a photon goes through the upper hole it may or may not get a random kick and get knocked off of course if it goes
19:01
through the lower hole it also gets a random kick now we're imagining the photons come
19:06
through one at a time we could even imagine a
19:13
okay i do that all the time
19:20
where was i yes the photons get a kick we're imagining that the photons come
19:26
through one at a time very sparsely and so what one
19:31
photon does doesn't influence a later photon because the later photon comes through
19:37
so much later that whatever gave the first photon a kick has already finished happening and
19:42
it's waiting for the next uh throw of the dice in fact the next photon may come through a hundred throws
19:48
of the dice later and so we expect the next photon uh to be
19:54
random statistically independent of the first photon under those circumstances what we would
20:01
expect well let's uh let's let's decide what we would expect supposing only one hole is open
20:07
if only one hole was open then we would see a blob of illumination like that
20:13
with a profile it might look something like that supposing we closed up the first blob the first hole and
20:21
opened the second hole close the first one open the second one all right so first
20:27
we begin with just one hole then we close the first hole and open the second hole
20:33
what would you expect to see what you would expect to see under those circumstances is a different blob slightly displaced
20:40
from the first one the blue blob wouldn't be there because we closed
20:45
the first hole the green blob would be there because we opened the second hole now
20:52
what happens if we open both holes what happens if you open both holes in classical mechanics
20:59
is the probability for a photon to get to the screen at any given point
21:04
is the sum of the probabilities for it to get there by either root
21:10
the photon photon can either go through the upper root or it can go through the lower route if
21:16
both holes are open the probability to get to this point over here let's call it the green point
21:23
over here the probability to get over there is the probability to go through the upper hole and arrive at the green point
21:30
plus the probability to get to go through the lower hole and arrive at the green point so the
21:36
result is in classical physics you would always see the signal over here the profile
21:44
over here just being the sum of the two probability distributions and it would look i wish i had another color
21:51
they never leave me enough colors all right uh we would see something which would look like
21:58
just a higher i don't know it would be much bigger than that
22:07
it would look like that and in particular if there was any point over here
22:12
such that the photon could arrive either from one hole or from the other hole or
22:19
both then we would find illumination at that point for sure by opening both holes
22:27
that's what classical logic let's let's call it that's right name classical logic
22:32
that's what classical logic classical statistics classical probability would dictate
22:37
for a series of particles coming through here one at a time
22:43
when they come through one at a time they make blip blip blip blip but the average probability of the
22:48
distribution of blips would be a distribution which would be the sum of the two distributions
22:56
what happens if you really do this experiment you find what's called an interference pattern
23:04
the interference pattern looks like this
23:10
well let's see let me get it right
23:19
in particular well first of all what is this figure this figure is a probability
23:26
distribution and it tells you the horizontal axis here tells you what the probability of a
23:32
photon getting to a particular point at a particular height here but in particular
23:38
it says that there are no photons which arrive at that point there are no photons which arrive at
23:44
that point there are no photons which arrive at that point this is odd if you opened only one hole
23:51
then you would find a probability distribution which wasn't zero in other words you would find
23:57
illumination at that point you open the other hole you still find illumination at that
24:03
point you open both holes and all of a sudden no photon gets to that point even though
24:11
they're coming in coming through once every 20 minutes or once every 20 years
24:18
and therefore how can they know about each other nevertheless if you open both holes
24:25
there will be places where no photons can get to despite the fact that photons arrived at those points
24:31
when only one hole was open that is um you might be able to sit down and
24:40
work up some in some interesting but rather elaborate mechanism to make this happen you could
24:48
imagine elaborate complicated mechanisms where somehow the this
24:56
this screen here some degrees of freedom inside the screen remember how many photons went through
25:02
and they remember what they're supposed to do but it would be a rather elaborate mechanism
25:08
just for this one purpose this phenomenon of interference of destructive
25:14
interference this is called destructive interference that the probabilities cancel instead of
25:20
adding at certain points that's a very generic property
25:25
in quantum mechanics and so it requires a kind of explanation which is not some
25:32
detailed mechanical complicated explanation it requires a a broad
25:40
new idea about how statistics works and how about how the logic
25:45
of um of quantum mechanics works so that's the first really weird thing
25:52
that happens in quantum mechanics now let me give you another example if
25:57
you remember in the last course we talked a little bit about reversibility we talked about the laws of physics in particular
26:04
we talked about the laws of physics for discrete systems for example uh we discussed the possible
26:10
laws of physics deterministic laws of physics for a coin
26:15
which can either be heads or tails now of course flipping the coin
26:21
that introduces a level of of uncertainty a level of
26:29
statistics probability into things i want to think about the deterministic laws the truly deterministic laws
26:36
are the ones that whatever the coin is doing it will tell you what the coin is doing
26:42
next so when we discussed this last quarter we talked about two possible laws of
26:48
physics the first was that if you find heads in the next instant when you look at it
26:54
after an instant of time you'll find heads again if tails then you find tails again then
27:00
your laws of physics just permit two possible um evolutions heads heads heads heads
27:06
heads heads heads or tails tails tails tails tails and the other possible laws of physics or law of physics
27:12
was that when you see a head in the next instant microsecond or whatever your unit of
27:18
time is you will see the opposite tails then the two possible laws of physics are the two possible not
27:25
laws of physics the two possible evolutions one of them begins with heads it goes heads tails heads tails heads tails
27:32
and the other one begins with tails and goes tails heads tails heads tails heads whether you know it or not those two different things were different they
27:38
began one with heads one with tails uh that was that was the basic
27:44
idea of a deterministic law of physics now you can have of course more complicated
27:50
systems in this just two state systems we imagine for example a six state
27:55
system a six state system was a die a die that can be one two three four five six but let's just take a simpler
28:01
thing let's take a coin with three sides if you can't imagine a coin with three
28:07
sides then you'll have to do this using abstract mathematics okay a coin with three sides has heads
28:14
tails and whatsoever else feet heads tails and feet all right heads
28:21
tails and feet all right and there are two all right
28:27
let's let's consider a simple law of physics a simple law of physics could tell you
28:32
that whenever you have heads it goes to tails whenever you have tails it goes to feet whenever you have feet it goes to heads
28:38
again and then wherever you start you just cycle around endlessly forever and ever now there's a certain
28:45
sense in which this is revers in which this is what does it mean to say it's deterministic
28:51
what does it mean to say information is not lost in this process what it means
28:58
is that no matter how long the system evolves
29:04
let's suppose you started with heads and you let it go a million units of time
29:11
it will just go around and around and cycle if at the end of that you reverse the law
29:17
of physics now reversing the law of physics just means having it go in the opposite direction
29:24
if you could somehow press a button or turn a knob which had the effect of
29:31
reversing the law of physics in other words changing the direction of every arrow
29:38
and think about actually if you could really do this by pressing a button change the law of physics then if you
29:46
allowed the system to evolve for any length of time at the end of
29:52
that time reverse it and let it evolve for the same length of time again
29:58
guess what it magically comes back to the same original configuration
30:05
that's what it means to say that physics is reversible or that's what it means to say that information is never lost
30:12
in physics that no matter how long you keep going
30:17
if you reversed if you could find a way to reverse the laws of physics and run them backward for the same exact
30:25
length of time you'll come back to the starting configuration now to do that
30:30
you might not even need to know the laws of physics you might need to know very little the
30:36
only thing you would need to know is how to reverse the law you need you needn't even know what the
30:41
law is whatever the law is if you can find a button to push
30:46
that reverses it then you can test the determinism of physics by simply starting some place letting it
30:54
evolve for a long period of time and then letting it evolve with the reverse law of physics
31:00
if you come back to the same place every time then your law physics is deterministic
31:06
now what about a little bit of classical probability a little bit of deity playing dice
31:12
so let's suppose with some very very small probability
31:18
the deity does something different that's not prescribed by the laws of
31:23
physics for example in some random way where the probability
31:29
of one in a million the law might say don't move instead of
31:34
moving the way the diagram says stay still if you allowed the system to evolve for
31:42
a short period of time then and then run it backward
31:50
it will go back to the same point but if you allow it to run long enough that there's a significant statistical
31:56
probability for a fluctuation for something to happen which is not deterministic
32:03
in other words if it was one in a million that you stand still but you let the system run for 10
32:09
million units of time then guess what no chance or not no
32:14
chance you have a chance that you'll come back to the same point but you'll also have an equal chance that you'll come back to any other
32:20
points in other words this test will fail it'll fail
32:26
uh one third of the time you will come back to the same point two-thirds of the time you will come
32:32
back to two different points so a little bit of classical
32:38
randomness destroys the um
32:46
what i called last quarter the conservation of probability no the conservation of information
32:53
information gets lost what about quantum mechanics is information lost well there is an
33:00
element of statistical things in quantum mechanics when a electron
33:06
goes through a hole like this it has a probability for getting kicked
33:11
up let's just take the case let's simplify now this is the one slit experiment
33:16
we don't even need the two-slit experiment let's start with the one-slit experiment
33:21
the electron goes to the slit it's aimed toward the slit sometimes it
33:28
more or less goes straight through sometimes it gets kicked up a little bit sometimes it gets kicked down a little
33:34
bit and you might think that this is more or less like throwing dice
33:39
in fact if you look for the electron afterwards if you look for the electron out here
33:44
after you've given it time to pass through at the moment now let's just send one
33:49
electron through one electron if we send one electron through
33:57
it may get kicked up it may go straight through or may get kicked down
34:02
if we do the same experiment repeatedly which is of course is the same thing as sending many electrons through but if we
34:07
do the same experiment repeatedly we'll find some go up some go down some but now let's ask the following
34:16
question supposing after a period of time we send an electron through
34:22
one electron after a certain period of time
34:27
having given it enough time to get to the other side but not but let's remove the screen over
34:32
here let's remove the screen send the electron through it goes through comes out someplace else
34:41
but we don't look at it we don't we don't bother detecting where the electron is instead
34:48
we just reverse the law of physics we do what we did over here reverse the
34:55
direction of time if you like can you really do this can you really is there really a button that
35:01
you can push is there really something that you can do to a system that will reverse
35:06
the motion yes in many systems there is in many systems we actually know how to
35:13
manipulate the system how to change magnetic fields how to do things to a system of electrons
35:19
so as to run it backward so let's take it as a as a given that after a certain amount
35:25
of time somebody can press the button that reverses the law of physics that reverses the direction of time so
35:33
to speak and runs the system backward for the same length of time what happens
35:41
does that electron we're not going to look at it but do we later after after the end of
35:50
the experiment we allow it to evolve for a time t and then we allow it to evolve backward for
35:56
another time t 2t altogether do we find the electron moving backward
36:03
along the original trajectory or do we find the probability the
36:08
fluctuations compounding and that after we turn it around there's
36:14
even worse fluctuation particle comes through gets knocked up
36:20
we run it backward it either gets knocked down and locked up which is it does it does it
36:28
reverse precisely along the original trajectory every single time
36:33
or does the statistical fluctuation the imprecision the the unpredictability
36:42
in one direction add to the unpredictability in going backward and make it even more unpredictable
36:50
afterwards than it was to begin with the answer is very curious
36:59
the answer is that if we don't look at the system in the intermediate stage after it's
37:04
gone through the hole over here don't look at it means don't interfere with the electron in any way
37:12
take that screen away that might have converted that electron into a little pulse of light
37:19
just remove any influence on the electron over here completely do not look at it do not
37:25
interfere with it do not do anything to disturb it but just run the law of physics backward
37:31
then we will exactly every single time detect the electron running back along
37:38
the reverse trajectory on the other side over here in particular we'll find the electrons
37:44
just going right back into the gun what if somebody does look at the
37:50
electron when it goes through to the side over here for example supposing somebody sets up
37:55
an electron detector which detects where the electron is and then lets it go
38:02
having reversed the law of physics we look at it and then reverse the law of physics now
38:08
in this case over here the case where we're talking about classical coins
38:13
looking at a thing doesn't disturb it very much if i have a coin
38:20
where's my coin i've lost my coin
38:26
it's okay it's only a chilean peso i lost my chilean peso
38:33
i think it was actually a hundred pesos okay now here's my chilean peso
38:40
i put it down and i put it down heads don't look at it now i look at it it would be rather
38:46
amazing if just the process of looking at it was capable of flipping it from heads to tails
38:52
now of course if i look at it with an intense enough uh high frequency light beam a beam of
38:59
very very energetic photons sure enough an energetic photon could uh could hit
39:04
the coin knock it into the air and spin it over that's true but you could but in classical physics
39:10
you can look at an object and determine its state determine the heads or tailsness of it
39:16
with an arbitrarily gentle interaction and so by looking at a system in
39:22
classical mechanics and looking at it with a very very gentle apparatus or very
39:28
gentle photon or whatever you like it does not entail disturbing the system
39:33
so if you look at it after you allowed it to go a million times and then reverse the law it will have no
39:41
effect no detrimental effect on the experiment and you will come back to the same
39:46
uh to the same point that you started with all right so just looking at the system
39:52
in between has no effect no does not necessarily have an effect on it
39:58
even though whoever looks at it can determine after a million units of time
40:06
where the system is here looking at it has no effect on what happens after you run it
40:11
backward exactly the opposite in quantum mechanics if you detect the object if you do
40:17
anything to detect the object electron in this case and then run the
40:23
law of physics backward what you'll find out is that the
40:29
probabilistic character of it gets compounded
40:34
so the fluctuation that's centered up here when you run it backward and you now
40:39
know that it came out up here and you run it backward it's likely to come out down here
40:44
or up here and it will disturb the system in such a way that the test of reversibility will fail
40:53
so this is curious that that whatever quantum logic is
40:59
the questions of the kind we're asking are deeply dependent on a ridiculous
41:06
question did somebody look at the system during the course of its evolution and
41:12
as i said of course looking at a system can disturb it but in classical physics we can look at
41:18
a system without disturbing it we can look at a system detect the system measure the system
41:24
as gently as we like arbitrarily gently and have arbitrarily small effect on it so that
41:30
running it backwards will be exactly as if we didn't look at it not so in quantum mechanics determining
41:36
the state of a system is never a small thing to do to the system
41:41
and this is an example it completely destroys the uh the experiment the two-slit
41:48
experiment has also a similar uh a uh
41:55
a similar story that goes with it
42:02
the story that i told you a moment ago about the interference pattern and the
42:07
destructive interference is only true if nobody records
42:13
which way the electron went through now when i say no body i don't mean a human being necessarily i
42:19
mean that nothing in the environment of the experiment records and remembers which way the
42:26
electron went through in other words after the experiment there is nothing in the environment of
42:32
this experiment which has recorded which way the electron went through nothing in here only no this hasn't this
42:40
also hasn't recorded where the electron went through if nothing records where the electron goes through
42:45
then there's an interference pattern but if you were to put a little demon over
42:52
there a real physical demon a real physical demon could be another electron it could be some some gas in the
42:59
apparatus some gas molecules in the apparatus whatever it is in such a way
43:07
that something records which way the electron went through
43:12
something remembers it afterwards perhaps a molecule over here gets disturbed
43:19
gets excited if the electron goes through the upper hole gets excited and changes the character
43:27
of that molecule if it goes through the lower hole it changes the character of a different molecule
43:32
so looking afterwards after the electron went through you can tell which hole the electron went through
43:38
then the interference pattern is destroyed and the answer is exactly the same as
43:44
the classical answer namely the probabilities add
43:51
just exactly as in classical physics so again there's no way
43:58
to record whether the electron went through the upper hole or the lower hole without seriously
44:04
disturbing the experiment without so seriously disturbing the experiment that you drastically can
44:11
change the conclusion that's a quantum that's roughly speaking the general
44:18
character of quantum mechanics that you cannot do measurements on
44:24
systems without disturbing them and disturbing them can change completely the character of a yuck
44:30
question
44:43
yeah that's a very very good question that's an excellent outstanding question uh
44:50
i wish i knew the answer no i know the answer um yeah i will uh the answer has to do
44:58
with the probability distribution for the position of the uh of the um of the
45:04
let's call this the detector let's call this the detector okay now if the detector
45:11
is very well localized in space as it would be if it were a heavy massive classical detector then
45:19
by the uncertainty principle which we haven't talked about yet if we're going to let me skip ahead
45:26
and imagine that we have talked about the uncertainty principle that's a sophisticated question so i suspect you
45:33
you've thought about it a little bit if the position of this detector the up down position of this detector delta x
45:40
is very very small that means that the uncertainty in the momentum of the detector is large
45:48
okay that means if i were to plot the probability distribution of the
45:53
momentum of the detector let's plot the probability distribution of the momentum of the
45:59
detector it's rather broad because for a heavy detector its
46:06
location is so well defined all right now the electron comes through
46:12
and kicks the plate kicks this thing a little bit it gives it a small kick and what does
46:17
it do it shifts this probability distribution a small amount
46:24
but unless the probability distribution has been shifted by something approximately equal to its
46:31
width then you can't tell afterwards whether it got a kick or not
46:36
right you have to be in order to be able to be certain that it got a kick you'll have to kick it by an amount
46:42
large by comparison with the uncertainty so it's the uncertainty principle that comes in and rests you
46:48
rescue rescues you or rescues me and makes sure that the interference
46:54
pattern is not destroyed the uncertainty principle itself so
46:59
let's go to the uncertainty principle since it's been raised since i raised it
47:07
the uncertainty principle there's another factor in quantum mechanics which is
47:14
extremely different than physic than classical physics conceptually very different i know we
47:20
haven't talked about the what the uncertainty principle is yet but let's uh let's discuss it anyway
47:27
let's jump ahead my main motivation now is to explain the strangeness of
47:35
not to explain the strangeness of quantum mechanics but the points and fingers at the strangeness of quantum mechanics
47:42
so that you see that it really is fundamentally logically different than classical
47:47
mechanics logically different whole logic of quantum mechanics is different
47:53
okay it's easy to imagine a bit of uncertainty in classical
47:59
physics as i said the uh the coin throwing or the dice throwing deity
48:04
who sticks his finger into the system and gives it a push this way i push that way and so forth and that way things after a short period
48:12
of time become uncertain and it's easy to imagine that that uncertainty can affect both position
48:20
and momentum and if you wait a little while both the position and the momentum may be uncertain in
48:28
fact if you wait a little bit or more than a tiny fraction of a second for a for a particle
48:33
you might discover that inevitably both the position and the momentum get jostled about and
48:40
so that there's a good deal or certain amount of uncertainty and position and uncertainty and momentum
48:47
but you would be unlikely to say that that uncertainty and position and momentum
48:53
is um what's the word i'm looking for uh well first of all that's fundamental
49:01
in any sense you would say it was a result of hitting the system randomly but i think most of us would agree that
49:07
under those circumstances it was a bit of laziness that didn't allow us
49:12
to watch the particle carefully enough to see what exactly the momentum was and the position was
49:18
we always imagine in that kind of classical context an example of that classical context
49:25
would be the random walk of a brownian moving particle right so
49:30
if we if we watch a whole bunch of particles a whole bunch of particles might form a cloud and that cloud might spread
49:38
and perhaps even the velocity of the cloud or the uh the cloud describing the velocities might also
49:44
spread but every one of those particles if we cared to we could look at with better
49:51
precision better and better precision we could look at it gently as gently as
49:57
we liked in classical physics and determine both its velocity and its
50:02
position simultaneously certainly that would be true of a
50:07
classical brownian motion particle that was being knocked around by uh by
50:13
ordinary collisions with uh some gas or something like that in principle
50:18
we could just get ourselves a better microscope better better accuracy
50:24
better precision better resolving power and do it very gently so as not to
50:30
disturb the system when we measure the position we don't want to jostle the momentum when we measure the momentum we
50:36
don't want to do something funny to the position and we just measure it gently enough so
50:41
that we measure both the position and the momentum that would be expected to be true for a
50:46
brownian particle so the uncertainty in position and momentum is something which in a certain
50:52
sense is due to our own laziness and not spending enough money and buying a good enough detector and so forth
50:59
to to be able to detect both the position and the velocity at the same time
51:06
on the other hand in quantum mechanics there's a really fundamental
51:11
obstruction a logical obstruction a deep obstruction to knowing that ever
51:18
being able to measure both the position and the velocity of a particle
51:23
i'm going to work it out for you and show you how it works i'm going to show you how heisenberg first thought about
51:29
it well he first thought about it entirely
51:35
through abstract mathematics for us that's going to come later but then when
51:41
questioned by boar what are you talking about that you can't measure the position and the velocity
51:46
simultaneously your mathematics is a is a crock of bologna don't tell me that
51:52
x times p is not equal to p times x come on it's like saying 3 times 5 is not 5 times 3
51:58
did i write it right yeah not equal to don't tell me such nonsense stories give
52:03
me some physics and so heisenberg cooked up his experiment to show
52:09
uh to illustrate the fact it's not show but illustrate the fact that there was a good deep uh consistent reason why it's
52:18
impossible to ever ever under any circumstances simultaneously determine the position
52:24
and the momentum of an object so let's go through that a little bit it has a similar character to some of
52:30
the other illustrations that i've given here
52:39
what heisenberg and bohr and einstein and all those people knew around 1926
52:47
was the property of photons in fact whenever they thought about measuring the properties of a particle
52:53
they were always thinking roughly speaking of looking at it under a microscope detecting it by bombarding it with
52:59
photons now it doesn't matter whether they were photons or not it's just that they were thinking about microscopes and they were thinking in a language
53:06
where you optically look at things it doesn't have to be optical but this is what they were thinking
53:12
so heisenberg imagined putting his particle under a microscope and detecting its position and its
53:18
velocity and seeing what he could learn okay the measurement
53:26
involved interacting with the particle with a photon a photon would be the
53:32
thing which would be used to determine the position of momentum in other words
53:37
looking at it really meant hitting it with some light letting the light scatter off and then
53:42
focusing the light waves focusing the light waves in order to see exactly where the particle was just as you would do it
53:49
for a billiard ball or for anything else focus the light on your retina focus the light on some screen and reconstruct the
53:56
position of the particle that was what they were thinking about
54:02
okay now here's what einstein and the broglie and others have taught them about photons first of all
54:11
einstein had told them that the energy of a photon is equal to planck's constant
54:18
times the frequency of the light describing the photon
54:24
this is equivalent to planck's other constant h bar
54:31
times the angular frequency where f stands for the frequency of a wave number of cycles per second measured in
54:38
hertz okay usually a frequency of a light wave is a lot of hertz how many hertz
54:46
how many 10 to the 15th for ordinary light that's just a number 10 to the 15th hertz
54:52
omega is the same as the frequency except multiply by two pi
55:00
it's the angular frequency instead of the instead of the number of cycles per
55:06
second all right and h bar is just h divided by 2 pi
55:11
so these are the same expressions i'll use this one over here for the moment energy is equal to h times frequency
55:18
that's something that was known by einstein now
55:24
here's another fact about a beam of light beams of light have not only energy but
55:29
they also have momentum you can take a beam of light and shine it on something and it will warm it it
55:35
will heat it that tells you it has energy but you can also take a beam of light
55:40
and you can shine it at that door and if the beam of light has sufficient intensity it'll just push the
55:46
door open in other words the beam of light has momentum uh so that when it when the door absorbs
55:52
the beam of light the door gets a kick just as if uh just as if you threw a
55:58
ball at the door and the door colliding with the wall it has momentum okay now what is the
56:06
relationship between the energy of a beam of light and momentum i'll just tell you what it is this is
56:13
this is classical maxwell theory of why uh if a beam of light
56:19
moving in a particular direction assume it's moving in a particular direction has energy e
56:26
then it also has momentum and the relationship is that the energy
56:34
is the speed of light times the momentum incidentally let's just check the units
56:40
of that equation in another way compare that with newton's uh
56:48
theory of momentum and energy for an ordinary particle the energy is p squared over 2m
56:58
that's non-relativistic the momentum b squared over 2m
57:07
which is equal to p times p over m and an extra one over two
57:16
one-half momentum times momentum divided by velocity now what's momentum divided
57:21
by velocity sorry momentum divided by mass velocity
57:27
so this is equal to one-half momentum times velocity
57:34
well it's almost the same for a photon there's a it's not the same because we
57:39
have to use the theory of relativity for a cosine but the correction from the theory of relativity is not so
57:46
uh so enormous this is one-half the velocity of the particle times its momentum this is just equal to the
57:53
velocity of the particle times the momentum so for highly relativistic particles the
57:58
formula is very similar except the half goes away among other things
58:03
this argument tells you that the units are right energy is velocity time to a minimum
58:11
let me just solve that momentum is energy divided by the speed
58:17
of light we can now plug in and find that the momentum of a photon
58:23
or momentum of any little piece of light let's do a single photon now the energy of the photon is h times f
58:30
uh so the momentum is h times the frequency divided by the
58:35
speed of light now if you have a wave that's moving with the speed of light
58:43
you have a way of moving with the speed of light it's moving down and it has a certain frequency and a
58:50
velocity there's a connection between the frequency
58:55
and the uh between the frequency and the wavelength
59:01
think about it for uh for a moment here's a wavelength
59:06
let's call the wavelength lambda lambda is a standard uh there's a standard notation for the
59:11
wavelength of light the wavelength of anything
59:18
how far does the wave move in one cycle
59:24
the answer is lambda that's what lambda is it's the distance that the wave moves in one cycle if you stand there with
59:32
your nose watching that light ray and it's moving past you all right it moves past you one wavelength per
59:40
cycle one wavelength per unit per cycle how long does a cycle
59:48
take how long does one cycle take what's the period that goes with one cycle
59:54
the inverse of the uh of the frequency so the time that it takes the time that
1:00:00
it takes to move distance lambda is one over the frequency so let's just
1:00:06
write that down time to go one cycle is equal to one over the frequency
1:00:12
the distance that it goes in that same time is just lambda so what's the velocity of the wave the
1:00:18
velocity of the wave is the distance that it goes divided by the time that it travels
1:00:24
distance all the time is velocity c is equal to lambda divided by t which
1:00:32
means lambda times the frequency so this is a general formula relating
1:00:38
velocity lambda and frequency and let's see let's plug it into here now
1:00:45
let's get rid of the frequency the frequency is c divided by lambda
1:00:52
so frequency is c
1:00:59
divided by lambda and then there's another c down here and we get the broglie's
1:01:07
equation that the momentum is planck's constant divided by the wavelength the smaller
1:01:14
the wavelength the larger the momentum if you want a beam of particles with very high
1:01:21
momentum give it a small wavelength or to say it the opposite way if you want a
1:01:27
very short wavelength particle it's at the cost of having that particle have a large momentum
1:01:34
momentum and wavelength are inverse to each other
1:01:39
so now let's let's go back to once the measure wants to get a roughly
1:01:46
speaking he wants to get a photograph of the electron where the electron is uh not fuzzy
1:01:53
on scales larger than delta x just wants to take a photograph of the
1:01:58
electron oh it doesn't have to be an electron it could be a golf ball doesn't matter
1:02:04
what it is once they get a photograph of it and wants the photograph to be non-fuzzy
1:02:10
on a certain scale delta x well every photographer knows that or anybody who
1:02:17
understands anything about waves and images and so forth knows that to form an image which is
1:02:22
precise or non-fuzzy the size delta x you have
1:02:28
to use wavelengths that are shorter than delta x if you're trying to make an image of a
1:02:34
golf ball with a radio wave a radio wave of let's say 10 meters
1:02:39
the golf ball will look fuzzy on the scale of 10 meters if you're trying to do it with a
1:02:45
wavelength of a tenth of a tenth of a golf ball a tenth of a centimeter the golf ball
1:02:51
will look pretty good so the rule is that lambda
1:02:58
the wavelength of the light must be less than delta x if you want to
1:03:03
get an image with precision delta x now i erased an equation the equation that i erased is that the
1:03:10
momentum is equal to planck's constant divided by lambda
1:03:17
so now heisenberg was caught in a bind if he wants to measure the position
1:03:24
to a high accuracy delta x he's got to use a um he's got to use
1:03:31
a high momentum electron that's gonna use a short wavelength electron if he wants delta x to be smaller than a
1:03:38
centimeter then he's got to be using a wavelength smaller than a centimeter
1:03:43
but if he's using the wavelength smaller than a centimeter that means the momentum of the photon
1:03:48
has to be larger than h over one centimeter so the smaller delta x the larger
1:03:58
the momentum of the photon that he has to use to make the image the shorter the wavelength of the photon
1:04:04
that he has to use to make the image if lambda is small then p is going to be large
1:04:10
well now what does that mean that means that we're going to wind up bombarding
1:04:16
this object with a high momentum photon the high momentum photon
1:04:23
may make a very good image of the position but then it's going to collide with this and knock it off in some random
1:04:29
direction knock it off in a random direction with a momentum
1:04:35
uncertain uncertain momentum of order of magnitude of this momentum here
1:04:42
this particle will come in and just like the photon hitting the slit
1:04:47
it will get knocked in some random direction and so the conclusion will be that
1:04:52
immediately after you try to measure the position immediately afterwards the momentum
1:05:00
has become very uncertain it has been kicked hard having been kicked hard if you measure
1:05:06
its momentum afterwards it will have nothing to do with the momentum beforehand
1:05:14
so you cannot determine both the position and the momentum at the same time
1:05:20
measuring the position necessarily imparts a random momentum a kick a
1:05:25
random momentum kick for the particle result is
1:05:31
whatever the momentum is before was beforehand it won't be that afterwards
1:05:37
and that's another example of the fact that there's no such thing
1:05:44
as a gentle determination in quantum mechanics well you can do a
1:05:51
gentle determination but it will be a very imprecise determination
1:05:56
in classical physics incidentally oh keep in mind uh why what about classical physics why is
1:06:02
it different in classical physics the reason is because light doesn't come
1:06:08
in discrete packets in classical physics we've used the fact that
1:06:14
that light comes in discrete indivisible quantum discrete indivisible protons
1:06:22
and if we have a wavelength then there's a minimum amount of energy
1:06:28
that can be that can go with that minimal amount of momentum that can go with that wavelength
1:06:34
namely one photon you can't have less than a single photon in classical physics energy does not
1:06:41
come in discrete multiples of some basic unit and so you can do the same experiment
1:06:47
with as small an energy as you like you could it's
1:06:54
as though in classical physics you could subdivide that photon into arbitrarily small units of body
1:07:01
take just one of them with the same wavelength and form an
1:07:06
image with it in quantum mechanics you're always stuck by the fact that the energy of a light
1:07:12
wave comes in these discrete packets and that discrete packet that it
1:07:18
has wavelength lambda will have a momentum h over lambda and therefore give this an inevitable
1:07:25
kick of a mountain overlapping now that's
1:07:31
this is several examples of the same kind of thing that doing
1:07:38
experiments in quantum mechanics is different than doing experiments in classical mechanics you can always imagine
1:07:44
classical mechanics doing a very gentle experiment that doesn't disturb a system and then just go on from there and do a
1:07:50
later experiment and do a later experiment the earlier
1:07:55
experiments not having influenced the outcome of the later experiments
1:08:01
so for example you could measure the position and that will and that not affect the
1:08:06
outcome of a later detection of the velocity which is not true in quantum mechanics
1:08:18
these are a lot of examples but the examples add up to a
1:08:24
so a if you like a notion that the basic logic of classical mechanics is incorrect
1:08:31
basic underlying logic is not sufficient to understand the measurement process in quantum mechanics
1:08:39
um the whole setup is wrong the whole setup not just not just particular it's not just each
1:08:45
experiment you can go and analyze it and try to figure out what's wrong with it and try to correct for it
1:08:50
no the whole underlying structure of classical physics is inadequate to discuss quantum
1:08:56
mechanical phenomenon uh let's take a break for five minutes and then
1:09:01
start formulating its proper
1:09:07
okay uh somebody asked me about how do you measure the velocity of a particle
1:09:14
uh the answer is gently first of all
1:09:20
uh here's a simple here's a simple conceptual way to do it velocity or momentum momentum let's
1:09:26
suppose we know the mass of the particle so but by uh that by measuring its um velocity we
1:09:32
also measure its momentum a simple conceptual way to measure
1:09:37
velocity is to measure um location at two different times and then take the difference of location
1:09:44
that's how far it travels and divide by the time between measurements and that's the velocity
1:09:50
that's the way you would measure velocity now you have to be careful you want to measure the you want to measure the
1:09:55
position twice in succession but you don't want to measure the position with such with such good
1:10:02
with such a good determination that it gives a random kick to the velocity which is what you're trying to measure
1:10:09
you wouldn't want to measure the velocity by beginning the experiment with a random kick which randomizes the
1:10:15
velocity and sends it off in some direction very different than it was moving with
1:10:20
to begin with direction and velocity so your two measurements of velocity sorry of position
1:10:28
should be very gentle measurements that don't change the velocity very much or that don't change the momentum very
1:10:34
much that means that they must be done with photons
1:10:39
of very long wavelength if you don't want your first initial detection of the location of this
1:10:45
particle to to to give it a good whack
1:10:51
then you want to do it with a very long wavelength photon a long wavelength photon will then
1:10:58
tell you only that the electron is in some region of size lambda
1:11:05
okay so what you know then is the position of the electron x let's say plus or minus lambda
1:11:13
meaning to say that there's an uncertainty of magnitude lambda then you wait a really really long time
1:11:20
until the electron has moved a long long ways it has some velocity it started out with
1:11:26
some velocity you've you've changed the velocity only by a very small amount
1:11:31
by using a very long wavelength photon so we take the wavelength of the photon to be so long that there's been an
1:11:38
unappreciable change in the momentum and then at a much later time we
1:11:43
discover that the particle is at x plus or minus lambda maybe even plus
1:11:49
or minus 2 lambda plus vt
1:11:55
is velocity times the time between the two measurements
1:12:01
so true there's a little bit of sloppiness in the measurement of the positions a large sloppiness
1:12:07
excuse me in the measurements of the positions and that's going to lead to a sloppiness
1:12:13
in the distance be that the particle moves what's the sloppiness the sloppiness
1:12:19
the distance that the particle will move will be vt plus a sloppiness
1:12:28
of order lambda and we take lambda to be very big so that so that we don't disturb the
1:12:35
velocity very much then how do you find this is this is how far the particle moves
1:12:41
let's call it d distance that it moves in order to find the velocity we have to
1:12:48
divide the distance that it moves by the time so let's divide it by the time
1:13:02
this is a this is now a measurement in the sloppiness of the velocity the sloppiness of the velocity
1:13:08
measurement is lambda divided by t no matter how big lambda is if we wait long enough if we let t be
1:13:16
very very large then the sloppiness and the velocity can be made small
1:13:22
so the way we measure the velocity is by taking a long time to do it do very very gentle measurements of the
1:13:28
position so that we don't whack the velocity and in that way we can measure the
1:13:33
velocity with great precision however it's been at the cost of knowing
1:13:38
where the particle is the particle is not been determined to a
1:13:44
precision better than lambda the velocity has been determined to a precision of something like lambda over
1:13:51
t so whatever you do you'll never be able to
1:13:56
determine both the position and the velocity in the same experiment
1:14:01
to do one and not the other one or the other
1:14:07
kind of quantum mechanics yeah
1:14:40
uh let's see you wait a very long time so that uh
1:15:05
that's that's because you're taking this to be the uncertainty and the velocity but there's also an uncertainty from
1:15:10
here that has to do with the original setup let me think about it you i understand
1:15:16
your question let me think about it and come back to you with an answer um
1:15:24
yeah it's a good let me let me come back to it
1:16:02
yes i see i see yes you can um you can determine the position of this
1:16:09
wall by averaging over a long period of time with photons many many photons banging off it
1:16:18
uh yeah yeah
1:16:28
i'm uh i'm um trying to remember what i was going to talk about we'll come back to the
1:16:34
uncertainty principle for sure but i'm i've lost the threat of my thought
1:16:45
all right so i i forgot what i was going to say but let's just move on
1:16:55
so the fundamental logic of quantum mechanics is not the same as the fundamental logic of classical mechanics
1:17:01
and that shows up at the earliest possible stage namely what do you mean by the state of
1:17:06
a particle what do you mean by the configuration what do you mean by knowing
1:17:14
everything that there is to know about a system or everything that can be known about a system
1:17:21
in classical mechanics the space of states what we call the phase
1:17:27
space we had some various versions of it in one version it was just a set of points
1:17:37
i use the word set and i use the word set on purpose a set of points the states of a system
1:17:44
heads tails or one two three four five six for a die
1:17:49
uh in particle mechanics or mechanics more that's a little bit
1:17:56
less primitive than this very simple system here it's phase space the states
1:18:01
of the system are phase space p's and x's p's and x's
1:18:07
uh points in a phase space are the states of a system but again the
1:18:12
collection of possible states of a system form a set they form a set they form a set of
1:18:19
points and the basic logic of classical physics of classical phase
1:18:24
space is set theory sets of points describe the possible
1:18:32
states of a system and transitions or motions from one point of in that set to another point in that set
1:18:40
describe the mechanics or the dynamics of a system in phase space it's the flow
1:18:45
through phase space what exactly is a state a state is a
1:18:51
point in that set a member of the set an x and a p for particle
1:18:59
a point h or t for heads and tails
1:19:07
or a bunch of p's and x's for a general system of many particles but a point or a member of a set
1:19:15
now you could think of something a little more general and possibly call it a state
1:19:22
in which you introduce a bit of statistics a bit of a probability or a bit of uncertainty from the beginning
1:19:29
you might say look i my apparatuses do are not sufficient
1:19:34
to determine with infinite precision the position and velocity of a particle
1:19:42
so instead of doing that i will say the particle is somewhere in some little
1:19:47
region here or i might assign a probability distribution a probability distribution as a function
1:19:53
of x and p which might be peaked at the center here and fall off as you move away from it
1:19:59
and so forth a probability distribution on phase space might even be a more general version of
1:20:06
what you mean by the state of a system but if i told you that the notion of a
1:20:12
state of a system is a probability distribution i think most of you will come back and say
1:20:18
yeah but you know if i look more carefully at the system if i look more carefully i can always
1:20:23
reduce that probability distribution and i can always get as close as i like
1:20:30
by doing delicate experiments and again in classical physics doing experiments
1:20:35
which don't disturb the system terribly much doing experiments on the system which will get it to be closer and closer to a
1:20:42
point so when you speak about a statistical distribution you're as being a state you're not
1:20:48
talking about the maximum amount of knowledge that you could have about a system
1:20:54
you're talking about an impr a a practical limitation because of the coarseness of
1:21:01
your apparatuses and so forth might force you to use a probability distribution
1:21:06
and only talk about things to within a precision that you can measure them but you wouldn't think that that was
1:21:13
very fundamental and eventually you would say with sufficient accuracy in your apparatuses
1:21:19
that uh that the maximum you can know about a particle corresponds to a point in the phase
1:21:25
space and in that sense states in classical physics are points in a set
1:21:34
points in a set and you can know everything that's
1:21:40
implied by knowing a point in the set in particular in this case knowing a p
1:21:46
and an x in quantum mechanics states are not sets do not form sets
1:21:54
the natural way of manipulating states and asking questions about them is not
1:21:59
set theory as not state is not set theory
1:22:07
states are vectors
1:22:12
in a vector space in quantum mechanics quite a different mathematical object than a set
1:22:19
a vector space is mathematically extremely different than a set and in order to understand quantum
1:22:25
mechanics this is not some abstraction that is really um sort of unnecessary to
1:22:31
understanding the subject this is so central that that to not talk about it we would completely
1:22:38
miss the basis of the basics of quantum mechanics what in order to understand
1:22:46
the logic of quantum mechanics we have to understand the mathematics of vector spaces
1:22:53
we're just forced to it there's no way around it if i tried to do things without it i'd
1:22:59
be faking so let's talk about vector spaces now
1:23:04
the use of the term vector or these are vector spaces linear vector spaces every vector space is linear
1:23:12
so linear is a redundant word but they're vector spaces over the complex numbers that may mean
1:23:19
nothing to you right now but it will as we go along vector space the space of states the state space
1:23:28
space of states
1:23:36
is not a set but it is a vector space
1:23:48
now the use of the word vector can be in vectors a vector space over the complex numbers
1:23:56
over c c stands for the complex numbers and i'll tell you exactly what this means if you don't know what it means
1:24:02
don't worry because you will know okay first of all most of us are
1:24:08
familiar with the notion of vector from the classical notion of a pointing
1:24:14
of a thing pointing in a direction an ordinary three-dimensional space with a certain length what i'm talking
1:24:22
about is not vectors in space in that sense these are abstract vectors in abstract
1:24:28
vector spaces which have nothing to do with your naive concept of a vector in space
1:24:34
as an arrow pointing in some direction in space with a given length when i teach this i usually
1:24:43
make a linguistic distinction between vector spaces and pointers in space which are the
1:24:49
things you usually think about as vectors uh i i can never quite figure out how to
1:24:54
do this without getting everybody confused including myself
1:25:00
i will try as much as possible when i'm talking about a three-dimensional vector in space
1:25:06
a kind of vector that could correspond to velocity or position or momentum and that sort of thing
1:25:12
i'm going to use the term pointer whenever there is any ambiguity about what i'm talking
1:25:17
about a pointer meaning a direction an ordinary three-dimensional space together with a
1:25:23
length i'll use the term pointer in order to not get confused
1:25:28
with a completely different mathematical concept or not a different mathematical to a much more general mathematical
1:25:34
concept called a vector space a vector space is a space of vectors
1:25:40
but of course these vectors are not pointers in ordinary direction of ordinary space pointers in ordinary
1:25:46
space are a special case of vector spaces but not the special case we're going to be interested in
1:25:53
okay so let me tell you what a vector space is first of all it's a collection of mathematical objects called vectors
1:26:01
again i'll emphasize over and over not vectors nor just abstract objects
1:26:08
called vectors maybe i should change their name and not the name of uh the vectors in
1:26:13
three-dimensional space we could go we could call them vectors or uh or schmecters but uh
1:26:21
but uh one way or another we've got to uh make some distinctions all right it's
1:26:28
a collection of objects which we can label let's label them
1:26:35
we can also label sets by points and give the points labels like a b and c and so forth but
1:26:42
now i'm labeling vectors and to indicate that they are vectors of the right kind
1:26:48
namely the kind that come into quantum mechanics we're going to draw
1:26:54
a symbol like that this is called a ket
1:27:02
vector it's called a ket vector by dirac there's another kind of vector called a
1:27:08
bra vector and if you put them next to each other they make a bra cat or a bracket that's where the name
1:27:15
came from but we'll come to brackets in a little while it's half a bracket a bracket being what happens when you put a bra
1:27:21
next to a cat is that clear yeah okay okay so there's a collection
1:27:27
of objects collection of objects called vectors
1:27:32
okay now what does it mean to say it's a vector space over the complex numbers what it means
1:27:41
is that first of all you can multiply vectors by complex numbers now the ordinary vectors in ordinary space
1:27:48
are a vector space over the real numbers if i have a vector for example three units of length
1:27:55
pointing in the direction north by northwest that are 45 degrees to the to the horizontal that would define a
1:28:02
pointer if you like all right so ordinary three-dimensional pointers
1:28:07
uh have a length and a direction you can multiply them by numbers if you
1:28:14
multiply a certain vector this one here this sorry a certain pointer
1:28:19
by 2 it just gets twice as long in the same direction if you multiply it by -1 it's the same
1:28:27
length but pointing in the opposite direction if you multiply it by seven and a half it becomes seven and a half times as
1:28:33
long so you can multiply of a pointer a pointer by an ordinary real number
1:28:42
positive or negative mathematicians would say that pointers
1:28:47
form a vector space over the real numbers vectors over the real numbers meaning to say that you can multiply them by real
1:28:54
numbers and when you multiply them by a real number you get another pointer back
1:29:00
we're going to make a generalization of that idea where vectors can be multiplied by
1:29:06
complex numbers now eventually we'll see some examples there's nothing like an example to
1:29:11
to make it clear but what that means is that given any vector you can
1:29:17
multiply it given a you can multiply it by any complex
1:29:22
number let's use for complex numbers let's use the greek alphabet
1:29:28
so if alpha is any complex number every i assume everybody here is
1:29:33
familiar with complex numbers i'm going to assume that i'm not going to teach you complex
1:29:38
numbers here you can multiply any vector by a complex number alpha
1:29:46
and it's the and it's a new vector not the same vector it's another vector so the operation of
1:29:52
multiplying by a complex number is well defined in a complex vector space
1:29:58
we can call this b for example multiplying by alpha maps every vector
1:30:04
into another vector alpha being any complex number that's
1:30:10
the first property of a vector space over the complex numbers sometimes we can call it a hilbert's i
1:30:17
mean sometimes it's just called the hilbert space vector space is over the complex number
1:30:23
a hilbert space hilbert was a mathematician so that's the first property given a
1:30:28
vector you can multiply it by any complex number and it's a new vector second property is that if you have two
1:30:37
vectors any two vectors let's call them a and b you can add them and you get another
1:30:46
vector so adding vectors give new vectors
1:30:53
now first of all here's something which is really these both of these things are really
1:31:00
new when you go from classical mechanics to quantum mechanics in classical mechanics the notion of a
1:31:06
state is a point in a in a space of points in other words in a set
1:31:12
it doesn't make any sense to multiply uh points
1:31:18
in a set by a number for example let's take heads and tails what does it mean to multiply heads by
1:31:24
three or heads by a complex number it doesn't mean anything you just have two points heads and tails
1:31:31
and that's all you have uh you don't have a thing that you would call three times
1:31:37
heads or or minus three times heads or two plus four times i times heads so in saying that state
1:31:45
vector that states of a system are a vector space this is something new and radical and weird
1:31:52
you should not understand this at this point unless of course you've done quantum mechanics before this should not make any sense at all
1:31:58
but for the moment we're doing some abstract mathematics to get some definitions and then i'll show you how those definitions
1:32:04
uh apply so first of all you can multiply a vector an abstract vector by any
1:32:11
complex number and you get a new vector that's an operation that you can do
1:32:16
and the next operation is that you can add any two vectors now of course if you can add any two
1:32:21
vectors and you can also multiply them by complex numbers then you can also then you can also
1:32:29
multiply the first vector by a complex number the second vector by a complex number
1:32:34
and that gives you some new i won't call it c i'll call it c prime
1:32:41
so what you can do with the vector space is you can take any pair of vectors
1:32:46
multiply both of them by arbitrary complex numbers add them and you get a new vector so the
1:32:53
notion of addition is well-defined of course for ordinary pointers
1:32:59
the notion of addition is also defined and it's defined by the operation
1:33:06
of drawing the parallelogram
1:33:13
ordinary vectors satisfy both of these rules that you can multiply a vector by any
1:33:20
real number i'm sorry not complex numbers ordinary pointers as i said are vector spaces over the
1:33:27
real numbers and that means that you can multiply any of them
1:33:32
by a real number and you can add any pair of any pair of pointers to get a new
1:33:37
pointer so ordinary pointers in space are a special case of a vector space over the real
1:33:43
numbers let me give you a couple of other examples
1:33:49
in particular vector spaces over the complex numbers this was the reason hilbert
1:33:56
originally invented the notion of hilbert space to describe functions functions of x
1:34:02
let's say functions of one variable for simplicity that's the simplest example
1:34:16
take the class of functions of one variable x let's take x to be the variable but
1:34:22
complex functions of one variable functions psi of x
1:34:31
which are the sum of two terms let's call it a real part psi real of x where psi real of x
1:34:40
always takes on real values plus i i being the square root of minus 1
1:34:46
times the imaginary part of psi every complex number is a sum of a real
1:34:53
part plus an imaginary part and every complex function now this is a
1:34:59
function of only one variable it's not a function of a complex variable it's a function of an ordinary
1:35:04
variable but the function itself can be complex all right so this means that for every
1:35:12
point x there is a complex number psi of x
1:35:18
or equivalently two real functions now let's take any complex function
1:35:26
let's take any complex function like this we can multiply it by a complex number
1:35:31
any complex number
1:35:36
defines a new function you can multiply the complex number psi
1:35:43
plus psi real plus i psi imaginary by air complex number alpha in other words complex numbers can be
1:35:49
multiplied and therefore you can take any complex number and multiply it by any function
1:35:57
so first of all functions of x satisfy the first rule
1:36:04
the collection of functions the collection of functions of x a collection of complex functions of x
1:36:10
form a vector space that's the that's the assertion we're going to check that first of all
1:36:16
you can multiply any function by a complex number and you get a new function all right so it satisfies rule number
1:36:22
one what about rule number two you can take any pair of functions and
1:36:28
add them together and you get a new function so if you have two functions psi and phi let's call them
1:36:43
that's another function a perfectly good one
1:36:48
so if psi and phi are complex functions their sum is a complex function that's enough to tell you that complex
1:36:54
functions are a vector space over the complex numbers real functions are a vector space over
1:37:03
the real numbers but they're not a vector space over the complex numbers why not
1:37:09
because you can't multiply a real function by a complex number and get back a real function
1:37:14
you'll get back a complex function you don't get back a real function so complex functions form a complex
1:37:21
vector space and that's the that actually is this with the vector space
1:37:26
that that hilbert was first interested in that's an example of a hilbert space
1:37:33
it's an important example in quantum mechanics maybe the most important example but for now i'm just illustrating
1:37:41
the the abstract mathematical definitions complex functions of x form a vector
1:37:48
space over the complex numbers let me give you another one
1:37:56
it's uh very similar
1:38:01
let's
1:38:15
let's invent a thing called a column vector a column vector is just a collection of
1:38:20
numbers which have and we can decide how many we fix the number of numbers
1:38:26
uh one two three any number we like but let's fix it right and we simply arrange them in a
1:38:33
column let's call those numbers let's give them let's call them a 1
1:38:40
a 2 a 3 and a 4. this would be a vector space of
1:38:46
dimension 4. we could also think of vector spaces of dimension 2
1:38:53
a1 and a2 just pairs of numbers pairs of complex numbers here's
1:39:00
quadruples of complex numbers we could make quintuples of complex numbers sex tuples of complex
1:39:07
numbers and we could even imagine infinite columns of complex numbers or just one
1:39:15
complex number just one complex number one unit long a one of x all of these
1:39:21
each one separately not all together but each one separately four dimensions or two dimensions or three dimensions each of
1:39:28
these form the collection of such objects form a complex vector space
1:39:38
vector space over the complex numbers so let's take this particular complex vector space
1:39:43
here a 1 a 2 a 3 a 4 where the a's are arbitrary complex numbers
1:39:52
if these are arbitrary complex numbers and we display them in a column like this
1:39:57
then i assert that there are rules which will allow this to be a vector space so what are the rules
1:40:03
i'm going to invent now a rule of addition notice so far there's been no rule of
1:40:09
multiplication of vectors only addition of vectors so the rule for
1:40:14
adding two vectors here's two vectors one i'll call a the other one i'll call b b1 b2
1:40:21
b3 b4 just add the entries this is the
1:40:27
definition of adding of column vectors
1:40:32
a1 plus b1 a2 plus b2 a3 plus b3
1:40:39
a4 plus b4 obviously with this definition
1:40:44
if you take any two vectors and you add them you get another vector the a's and b's
1:40:52
are arbitrary complex numbers but each specification of four complex
1:40:58
numbers defines a vector there are two vectors one labeled a one
1:41:03
labeled b here's a third one that you can make out of it all right so i started uh for some
1:41:10
reason i started with the addition rule here but it's also true that we can invent the idea of
1:41:16
multiplication by a complex number if we want to take a vector let's call it a 1 a 2 a 3 and a 4
1:41:24
and multiply it by the complex number alpha we just do that by multiplying every
1:41:30
entry by alpha alpha a1 alpha a2
1:41:35
alpha a whoops alpha a3 and alpha a4
1:41:42
we multiply every entry by the same number that defines multiplication by a complex
1:41:49
number and all i've done is multiply complex numbers here
1:41:54
obviously given any vector in any complex number i can make another vector by multiplication not multiplication of
1:42:01
vectors but multiplication of numbers by vectors and given any two
1:42:07
vectors you can add them so the collection of objects arranged in a column this way
1:42:15
also form a vector space now if i were to take the collection that consists of vectors of length 2
1:42:23
length 3 length 4 and combine them all together that's not a vector space because i
1:42:30
haven't given you any rule for adding a vector with with length 2 to a vector of length 3. i haven't told
1:42:37
you how to do that and i don't see any obvious rule for that so it's
1:42:43
uh with this set of rules the collection of two-dimensional vectors three for the
1:42:49
whole shebang does not form a vector space but for a given length fix the length it
1:42:56
forms a vector space and the terminology is that it forms a vector space in this case of dimension
1:43:02
four now of course this has an analog
1:43:08
for ordinary pointers for pointers we can just think of these as the
1:43:14
components of the pointer along the different axes pick some axes
1:43:19
x y and z and pointers have components so we can also specify an ordinary
1:43:25
pointer by specifying a collection of components
1:43:31
or collection of components along different axes and that that also defines a uh
1:43:39
a pointer so it's natural to call these numbers the components
1:43:45
of a vector and we'll come back to the uniqueness of components
1:43:53
you can if you like think of such a column as a function of
1:44:00
the index variable here well let's let's get that's too abstract let's let's drop
1:44:06
that for the moment we'll come back to it can be thought of as a function but uh we don't need to
1:44:18
now of course i've told you nothing about in what possible sense what possible sense can it make to identify
1:44:26
vectors with states of systems we're not going to do that tonight tonight we're just going to talk about
1:44:32
about the abstract notion of a vector tonight and a bit of next week we'll talk about the abstract notion of a
1:44:37
vector and then we'll talk about how vector spaces define uh the states of a system and then go on
1:44:45
and work out some examples of uh of uh quantum mechanical systems described by such
1:44:50
vector spaces at the moment this should be sort of um mumbo jumbo
1:44:55
right success success what success in
1:45:02
in making mumbo jumbo no i think i've given you rather accurate definitions that you can
1:45:07
understand of what vectors are and how to manipulate them how to
1:45:13
how to manipulate them how to do the abstract operations with them these abstract operations are in many
1:45:20
ways analogous to the abstract operations that you do with set theoretic logic with boolean
1:45:26
logic these abstract these abstractions for
1:45:32
how you manipulate vector spaces are the generalizations if you like
1:45:39
of how boolean set theory allows you to ask uh less allows you to
1:45:45
combine concepts together and or all these ideas have some meaning
1:45:50
in uh set theory what is and and is you take two sets and you combine them and make the union of them or
1:45:56
you take the intersection or is it the other way it's the other way isn't it it's the other way sorry and is the intersection or is the is the
1:46:03
union of two sets the analogous logic in quantum mechanics
1:46:08
doesn't operate on sets it acts on vector spaces so it's best that we get rid that we go
1:46:15
through vector spaces once and for all it's the basic underlying mathematics and once we get familiar with it it
1:46:21
won't seem so uh so much mumbo-jumbo but at the moment we're doing abstract mathematics any other question
1:46:28
okay so let's continue with the abstractions
1:46:38
now there's a notion of every for every such
1:46:43
vector space well let's let's leave this here there's a notion of a dual vector space
1:46:51
the dual vector space is in one to one correspondence with the original vector space well let's go back a step
1:46:57
let's just talk about complex numbers for complex numbers
1:47:06
incidentally complex numbers are themselves a vector space you can multiply complex numbers by a
1:47:12
complex number you can add complex numbers they're just the case of one dimension one-dimensional vector
1:47:20
spaces over the complex numbers are just the complex numbers
1:47:25
now there's an operation that you can do on complex numbers which is called complex conjugation it's a very
1:47:33
important operation and all it is if you think about the
1:47:39
cartesian plane if you think about the complex plane the real part of a number being on the
1:47:46
horizontal axis and the imaginary part being on the vertical axis
1:47:53
then the number then is described by a real part
1:48:01
the real part is the horizontal component and the the imaginary part of the
1:48:07
vertical component and we will just write that this number usually called z is equal to x plus iy
1:48:18
the complex conjugate number is just the number reflected
1:48:24
about the horizontal if this is a number called z x plus i y
1:48:31
then x minus i y is called z star
1:48:39
x minus i y is the complex conjugate of x plus i y or z star is the complex conjugate
1:48:46
of z let's uh let's manipulate something let's let's consider the product of z times z
1:48:52
star z times z star what is it
1:49:00
it's equal to x plus iy times x minus iy
1:49:06
that's x squared now we get i x y and then we get minus i
1:49:14
x y from the cross terms they cancel and then plus y squared why did i write
1:49:19
plus y squared because i times minus i is plus one
1:49:24
i times i is minus one so i times minus i is plus 1. z star z
1:49:32
is x squared plus y squared what is x squared plus y squared x squared plus y squared is the
1:49:38
square of the length of this hypotenuse here so z star z is the square of the length
1:49:48
or the square of the magnitude of the number or its distance from the origin
1:49:53
so complex conjugation is a convenient uh operation among other things the complex
1:50:01
conjugate times a number is uh the mag square of the magnitude of the number
1:50:08
um and if you're not
1:50:16
most of you of course are quite familiar with complex conjugation i want you to think of it as a very very basic operation but more than that i
1:50:24
want you to think of it as a mapping of the numbers back into the numbers
1:50:29
given any number any complex number you can map it to its complex conjugates
1:50:36
what about vector spaces i think we should probably quit now i think it's time to quit now next time we'll go through a little more
1:50:42
about vector spaces vector spaces operators uh hermitian operators and
1:50:48
eigenvalues and then we'll begin applying it to quantum mechanical problems
