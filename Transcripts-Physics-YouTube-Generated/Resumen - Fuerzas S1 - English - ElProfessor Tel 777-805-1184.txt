0:22
okay okay okay good um okay let's see we continue with what
0:31
we are seeing well we are going to make a review so you have it also like all the week all the review of the week so
0:38
let's see it okay remember that we were seeing right the three Newton loss right the three Newton loss were really easy
0:45
remember that the three Newton laws were about well the first one is the inertia law right the inertia law is about the
0:53
inertia right n remember that the video that I put you right where um okay where
1:00
remember that basically says that an object is going to maintain its velocity
1:06
unless there is a resulting Force different from zero right acting to the
1:11
object this means for example some examples is when we are driving right when we put the breake right the car
1:19
stops but we don't have any for that is stopping us that's why like we need the
1:24
seat Bel right that's why we need the airbags in order to stop us right from going out from the car right that's
1:31
thanks to well that's the force that we need in order to stop our velocity also the ntia is the one that allow us for
1:37
example to walk inside um a bus right remember that that is the one that allow
1:44
us also the same in the airplane right as I have put you like a lot of time let's put it again but the malcol in
1:53
right do you remember that for example Malon it says about the velocity of the
1:58
air right that that's why we see that a three uh I don't know a building
2:03
something like that is like at rest the velocity is equal to zero but that's for
2:08
us because if someone see us from Mars right they are going to say that it's moving because remember that we already
2:15
have the same velocity of the Earth that's why we don't feel it but like if it accelerating we will feel it right
2:22
remember that what we feel is basically the acceleration that TS also to the inertial low okay let's see now okay
2:38
okay just for you to remember really fast
2:45
[Music]
2:50
okay okay right remember
2:58
yes
3:21
okay right okay basically is that that the that the first Newton Law inertia
3:27
right okay say have show you right some example like the right when we stop when
3:34
we are walking inside a bus or an airplan right that's the inertia right
3:39
the first Newton Law okay the second Newton Law is reallyy yeah
3:49
Mar yes yes
3:56
yes well yeah yeah okay
4:19
[Music]
4:27
okay graas
4:58
spee
5:12
[Music]
5:26
foron okay Second newon Law right okay good the second Newton Law right it
5:34
says that what is what yeah yeah uh the second Newton Law guys says that the
5:42
it's just a formula right the force is equal to mass times acceleration right the a is the acceleration right and the
5:50
M right is the mass good that's uh really important right and remember that
5:56
the force the the unit is the Newton right of acceleration is met per second
6:01
square right okay good and mass is kilogram right okay remember that I told
6:08
you that people for architecture mechanic engineer and Robotics and physics really important this remember
6:15
that we have the equilibrium right the equilibrium is when we have a static that is when the velocity is equal to
6:21
zero right and dynamic when the velocity is constant right good okay then this is
6:28
right remember that well I'm talking about the rain right that's why we are not in the classroom right that's the
6:35
dynamic equilibrium guys remember that this drop of water right it has the weight right that the weight is the
6:42
force due to the gravity to any object right inside there okay in here this is falling but remember that there is an
6:49
air resistance right okay so these ones make equal to zero right this the sum of
6:56
these two forces is equal to zero right so it will continue with the same velocity because that's from the first
7:02
Newton Law right the that is going to continue with the same velocity so
7:07
um okay going to continue with the same velocity right that is 7 m/ second
7:13
that's because that process of stopping the drop of water is not like instantly right it has like some time really small
7:21
but it still has time right in order to get that velocity but that's is going to be a constant velocity of 7 m per second
7:28
until it falls right that's what what happens with rain like yesterday right
7:33
that it rain a lot so basically that's what happens that's the first and second NE law com combined right and well
7:40
remember that we have right the equilibrium equilibrium with the sum of
7:46
the forces is equal to zero right is where the form of the forces is equal to
7:52
zero so we have that Force One Plus Force two plus Force three right and plus Force n it means that you can have
7:59
n forces that means that you can have one two 3 1 million 100 million
8:05
whichever number of forces that the system has right the important thing is that for something to be in equilibrium
8:11
it should be equal to zero right okay good equilibrium remember that we are in
8:17
a three dimensional universe so this means that in order to be something in equilibrium we need that the three
8:22
dimensions are in equilibrium right x y and C right good okay and well we also
8:30
have some things that are Dynamic right yes in fact they have an acceleration
8:35
that basically is the sum of all the forces right the sum of all the forces is equal to the total mass the total
8:42
mass basically masses okay good and the sum of all the masses right and the
8:49
acceleration right of the system that I told you that a system should have always the same acceleration right
8:55
because they are joined together okay good so right that's basically the second NE
9:03
mass or acceleration mass times acceleration right one of the most important and most famous formulas like
9:10
like in everything is the second Newton Law okay good okay and well we also have
9:16
the third Newton Law right the third Newton Law it says to any action there is an reaction right so some example
9:23
remember that swimming for example Alo right like when he jumps
9:31
right and scores the goals right or the goals right he um he uses a lot the
9:38
Newton Law right because exactly like he uses right the power of his feet right
9:44
in order to okay
9:52
good okay good okay remember
10:27
Newton low right
10:42
okay that's the thir Newton Law
10:52
guys that is a third Newton Law guys like when he jumps right he uses a lot
10:59
that right okay that's perfect example of the
11:06
turn commandante right good so
11:12
okay good
11:19
good okay well like swimming also Michael F right like pushing a wall like be
11:27
remember that also that's really important that's going to be really important for our programs right in this
11:33
subject because we have the normal force remember that the normal force for example right it was like the squid game
11:39
right remember the squid game the scene right let's put it this just in here so
11:47
okay okay wait remember from a squid game right
11:53
like if the FL it doesn't have the enough mechanical resistance to generate
11:58
then normal force that's what's going to happen
12:04
right okay in there yes remember that the um well the gas right the bridge it
12:09
has the the force right enough to make it to well yes no not to fall right it
12:17
can generate the normal normal force remember in the in there the gas right
12:26
it was not tempered it was normal gas then have the enough Force right to
12:31
generate the normal force that it will cancel its weight right his weight and that's why he start falling right
12:38
because there is no equilibrium okay remember that when there is no equilibrium guys is when it happen the
12:45
acceleration okay [Music] good let's continue let's
12:56
continue okay right okay the turbine that take off of an spaceship swiming like that right okay
13:04
remember that the 10 Newton Law basically says that always that you apply a force right to an object this object will return you right the the
13:13
force right with the same magnitude but opposite direction right okay basically
13:19
that's why it says that Newton Law we have many examples okay right let's continue okay the weight guys the weight
13:28
basically is the force due to the gravity it has a name right this is going to be for sure a question in your
13:33
exams right they are going to ask you like if you have the same weight here and in Mars something like that or in
13:39
the moon right if you remember the video right of the girl that she said she said
13:45
that there was no um what well there was no gravity on Earth right that's not
13:52
true sorry in the moon she said that that there is no gravity in the moon that's false right this gravity is lower
13:58
than in here but uh you still have it right that's why in the moon you wait less right okay good what else what else
14:07
guys uh okay good good good okay what
14:13
else what else guys okay yeah um remember the weight right the weight
14:20
is different in every planet but the mass is universal right it's a universal
14:26
property of the matter right then mass of the object is the same in any part of
14:32
the universe right the mass the weight no the weight is a force the mass is a
14:37
property of the matter right okay remember that there are two type of forces right the contact and the
14:43
distance the contact forcer remember that when the the two objects are like in contact right the distance is when
14:51
they are not for example distance forces it can be like gravity it can be like magnetism if you remember also from what
14:59
let me put it [Music] okaying
15:04
back okay good
15:13
right
15:19
okay let me put
15:27
it okay good
15:37
right okay right remember this is like a
15:44
distance Force right the magnetism is an example of that right that basically the
15:51
things are moving right and they are not like touching the magnet so basically it's like that it's like the gravity we
15:58
are not in contact with the with the center of there right so but still it
16:04
attracts okay good uh okay guys so the
16:10
three body diagram right the normal force right the remember well that in
16:16
all these problems right of forces right we are going to have something that is called the free body diagram as I have
16:22
told you before right the um the forces right the yeah when we have problem of
16:30
for we have to dra body diagram and the same name says half of the answer body
16:36
di di is Right
16:41
body it means that if we have five bodies we need to draw five diagrams for
16:47
each body we need to draw all the forces that are affecting this object right
16:52
good for example remember that always that we are on the earth and this is in the ground right we are going to have
16:59
the weight right and this as this object is not falling as it is not fing right
17:05
as it is not falling is because this weight should be right equal well there
17:11
should be another Force right that cancels the weight that force is called the normal force that remember the
17:18
normal force is the force that is generated by the ground is the one that stop us right now if just see right in
17:25
the share then you the Share is resisting the way of you that's why I
17:30
don't know if you have seen like all the Spider-Man movies when this do o right
17:36
this octopus right when him like that's something really funny because when he
17:43
like carries like something with like his four arms right his four mechanical
17:49
arms right and he leave a car or he live an structure right of metal that will be
17:55
not possible because if you do that all the weight that he
18:05
lifting like he all his spine right all his legs will have to resist like Tes so
18:12
it will have to resist a l wake and that will well kill him right so that's not
18:18
true the only way that he could do that is like if two of his arms are like in the ground
18:25
right are his mechanical arms and not his legs because if he uses four of his
18:30
legs or if he uses like if there is not the force made by the arms and is made
18:36
by his legs or his spine he will die but okay basically that's something that is
18:41
not realistic well Spiderman not realistic but that thing of physics is definitely not realistic
18:49
so if you sometime some day invent some mechanical arms remember don't don't use
18:56
the force to try to LIF something because at the end you will have to lift all that weight in your spine okay good
19:05
okay so right the um and the example number
19:12
two remember that we had for example this Mass right that is being well is
19:18
receiving a force of 10 Newtons to the right okay remember guys always the first step is to do the fre diagram the
19:24
fre diagram is just to do all the forces that are affecting the system this system is affected by three forces the
19:30
normal force the weight and the this Force okay remember that okay here we
19:35
have a two dimensional problem because we have in X and in y y and x the sum of
19:41
the forces in X we just have one force so it's going to be 10 Newton remember the second Newton Law guys this one
19:49
right the second Newton Law one of the most important most famous formulas like in all the world right is this one force
19:57
is equal mass time acceleration right okay we have a force of 10 Newtons a force of 10 Newton right we have a mass
20:04
of 10 kilg a mass of 10 kilogram right so in order for us to get the acceleration right of the system is
20:11
going to be really easy we just have to isolate this 10 kilogram go to the other
20:17
side this one is multiplying we pass it to the other side dividing so we have 10 Newton divided by 10 kilogram that's
20:22
going to give us 1 m/ second squar right good okay and that's acceleration in X
20:30
they are also asking what the normal force is releasing the normal force minus the weight should be equal to zero
20:37
the weight is just the formula right mass time G right okay 10 * 9.81
20:44
98.1 Newtons right this one is subtracting we have it minus
20:49
98.1 we pass it to the other side how adding right that's why the normal force
20:56
is like this and it's positive and it's l right because the normal force always always points down sorry always points
21:03
with a 90 degrees right of the ground right good okay so basically it's
21:13
like that let's see the example number three right example number three guys basically it says the following right
21:21
the okay yeah the normal force right we have this object that is being right p
21:28
but this person right with 100 Newtons with an angle of 35° and this generates
21:34
an acceleration of 1 m/ second squar to the right in the X direction right good
21:41
so we have three forces this one this one and this one this Force has an angle
21:46
so we can translate it to its components right the force in X and the force in y
21:54
right okay good so we next remember the first step is to dra the fre diagram the
22:00
second step is to put the equations of the forces as we have two Dimensions
22:07
guys we are going to use right and two equations the force of the X right and
22:13
the forces in y right as this object is not fing and as it is not falling
22:26
right right good in why in X it is moving because they are telling us that
22:32
we have an acceleration of M second square right okay good so let's see inex
22:38
we have right that is going to be dynamic dynamic remember is the second LW Su of the forces should be equal to
22:46
mass times acceleration in X right because this is in X okay the force of
22:51
the person in X right that is the only force that we have in X that is the component of this Force right we can get
22:58
releasing is just the cosine of 35 multiply right by 100 we have it that
23:08
where good yes uhuh we have it there right and here we have it here
23:15
okay right okay the force of the person in X is 100 Newton mtip by the cosine
23:22
right of 35 right this is this part of the equation the mass right we don't
23:29
have it yet but we have the acceleration in X because they gave it right we have
23:36
the acceleration okay we want to get the mass of the object we need to isolate
23:41
guys okay this one is multiplying how do we pass it to the other side dividing so
23:47
we have that 100 Newton mtip by cosine of 35 is 8192 Newtons 8192 nton divided
23:55
by 1 right is going to be equal to 8192 kilg 819 8192 divid 1 is the same
24:06
but okay Newton divided by m/s square is going to give us kilogram right because
24:11
that's the unit for mass good okay now that we have the mass of the object now
24:18
that we calculate we can get the weight okay the mass of the object is
24:23
8192 right multiply by G right by the gravity and that's going to give us if you do it
24:29
in your calculator is going to give us this okay this right and the way well
24:36
the force of the person in y is really easy to calculate the force of the person in y is equal to the magnitude
24:43
100 Newtons multip by the sign of the angle 35° right 35° good okay so we do it right and we
24:52
get that that's going to be 57.36 this 57.36 we added to the weight remember
24:59
that the weight is pointing down so should be negative right and that's going to give us like - 7 46.
25:07
231 normal force equal to zero this one is subtracting we pass it to other side
25:14
adding right so we pass this one and this one finishes being positive and that's what we have here and we solve
25:20
our problem good okay let's continue you have everything like recorded you can
25:26
see it later like slower right but so you can have everything recorded how do you do each
25:34
right each problem in here really easy guys you have like these two right these
25:40
two
25:50
ropes attention to right in here they are not giving us the angle that we are
25:56
used to use right the one so we need to get them right in order to get them we
26:01
have to remember something about math 4 or like in secondary school also that is
26:07
right the Ang internos external good so okay guys because in here if you see
26:14
this is parallel lines parallel lines right and this angle is equal to this it's equal to this equal to this
26:20
remember that the sum of this angle should be equal to 1 this important because so the sum of this should be
26:26
equal to 1 180 18 180- 130 is going to be 50 so this angle is going to be 50
26:34
right and this angle is the same as this one that is one of the one that we are looking so the angle of T2 is going to
26:41
be 50 and we put it like that right good okay the second angle this angle that we
26:47
want to know right is going to be equal to this the same 180 minus 40 right that
26:54
they telling This is 40 that's going to be 140 40 140 is same is the same that
27:01
in here that the angle for T1 that is this okay good the angle of T3 is the
27:08
angle that it gets this this is 90 this is 180 this is 270 good we have the
27:15
three angles excellent now remember that we have to do like the both equations
27:23
okay remember that the sum of the forces in X is equal to zero the sum of the forces in is equal to zero right good
27:29
okay then remember that okay for getting the X component right we can get it like
27:37
multiply the magnitude multiply by the cosine right okay we use it for each of
27:42
the forces right you have three forces and each force it has its X and Y components
27:50
right good so we do it right we start calculating the cosine of angle T1 angle
27:58
of T2 angle T1 is 140 that's why we have cosine of 140 right okay the cosine of
28:05
angle to cosine of 50 that this is 50 right and we do it for each of them
28:10
right and okay then the T3 remember this
28:16
T3 we can see that is going to be equal to the weight of this mass is going to
28:21
be 10 kilog right 10 kilog m remember the formula of the weight is mass G
28:27
right mass times acceleration right 10 * 9.81
28:32
right that's going to be 98.1 Newtons guys right good okay and when we
28:39
substitute everything we are going to finish having this pair of equation
28:46
these two equation right okay these two equations guys remember that what is
28:52
that it's a system of linear equations we have two equations
28:58
right equation number one equation number two right and we have two
29:03
unknowns unnown one unnown two right we want to determine them so we use any of
29:10
the four method that you have already seen right in secondary school and in math to right that is basically
29:17
substitution elimination evalation or graphical we use in here substitution
29:24
substitution guys is really simple you for example choose the first equation
29:29
okay and you choose that you want to determine well you want to isolate T1 we are going to isolate T1 okay this one is
29:37
adding guys how do we pass it to the other side subtracting right like this
29:42
okay this one is multiplying how do we pass it to the side dividing as simple as that okay this one divided by this
29:50
one is going to give us T1 is equal to that okay good okay this one right we
29:56
know that T1 is equivalent to that so we can do the following right this T1 right
30:02
we are going to substitute it remember that's why it's the name right
30:08
substitution right in here so we are going to replace the T1 right for this
30:14
okay that is what we are doing in here this one is multiplying this and if you
30:19
put it in your calculator this multiply by this is going to give you this okay
30:25
this and plus this right we are in the same
30:32
variable just one variable right here we have it right is the same variable so we can add them we can add the coefficients
30:39
we add the coefficients in the calculator okay and we have that that's equal to 98.1 right because well same
30:48
this was subtracting how do we pass it to other side adding right good okay
30:53
this 1.35 right is multiplying the t2 how do we pass it to the other side dividing
31:00
okay you have this divided by this right and you are going to get that T2 is equal to that guys okay this guys okay
31:10
the same that's why it's called substitution right you are going to replace it right for example in here you
31:17
replace it in here and this T2 is equal to this and it's going to be just multiplying the 0 point well 0. 8391 m
31:27
by the 75149 and that's going to give us that the T1 is equal to
31:33
this right good okay let's see okay then
31:39
panado right okay let's see it again right okay remember that in here okay
31:46
they are going to let's see the system before okay we have a mass of 20 kilog on the right that it has a velocity of 0
31:54
m/ second so it's static okay we have a tension of a rope that is stopping right
31:59
that object from moving okay good so let's see we are going to have as always the weight right let always Point down
32:07
we're going to have the normal force that always always remember is perpendicular right so this is going to
32:13
be perpendicular and we have the tension right good we have these two forces in
32:18
plan what we do is to rotate our axis right we're going to rotate it and
32:24
remember that this is important because we are not going to use this angle right okay we can use that angle but if we use
32:31
that angle remember that we have to invert so if we use the 50 right we
32:37
instead of using um for instead of using for X the cosine we are going to use
32:43
sign right and instead of why using the sign we are going to use cosine that if
32:50
we use the 50 guys okay we use the angle that they giving us right why because
32:57
remember that that's the angle and the one that we normally use
33:03
is the ones that are go to the XIs right
33:16
so but in order not to do that right we can have another method right that is
33:23
basically the 90 minus this angle this because okay okay guys the logic is like
33:28
this this is 90 right this is 50 and that the sum of the should be 180 the
33:33
sum of this angle and this angle should be equal to 90 so if we get 90 minus 50
33:39
we're going to use
33:44
40 right so this one right we can use it and if we use this one we can use the
33:51
normal on yes as always right business as usual
34:00
right X for cosine and Y for sign right we use it like this I use it like this
34:06
in here remember that the weight is equal to mass time G the mass is 20 kilog the G is 9.81 we get that the
34:13
weight is this and we are going to get the X and Y component right of the weight as we have it in here okay this
34:20
is the X component right that is going to be multiply the cosine of the 40 not 50 not 50 40 right that we got it here
34:28
okay multiply by the weight and that's going to give us the WX w y the component y of the weight
34:35
right is going to be equal to the sign of 40 mtip by the W right and okay guys
34:41
in here right it will be just really
34:48
simple and we going to isolate and we are going to get this values right okay
34:55
and well just to see the last last one right of Dynamics right remember all
35:02
that previous it was when we have that it was static that the acceleration it was equal to zero in Dynamics is the
35:09
opposite we have to have that the acceleration is different from zero right okay for example in here we have a
35:15
problem where we have three person three people right in an elevator right and
35:21
this has a motor right that has a rope that is generating a force right that it
35:26
make that this elevator has an acceleration of 2 m/ second square right
35:31
okay so in order to do that right we need to calculate how many forces we have we have the three weights right and
35:40
we have right the weight of the elevator and we have the force of the motor right
35:46
okay so we add right the weight of these three people right plus the weight of
35:51
the elevator and we have to these ones are pointing down right the the force of
35:57
the motor is pointing off the forth of the motor should be greater than the force well the weights right because it
36:04
wins them and it also generates this acceleration so we have that the force of some of the forces in y is equal to
36:11
the mass total mass times acceleration this is just a second Newton LW the total mass is just adding all the masses
36:16
we have three people that has a mass of 70 so it's 70 plus 70 plus 70 because
36:22
the elevator has a mass of 1.5 T 1,500 kg right so we have that the total mass
36:28
is going to be this you put in your calculator right good okay we have this one the sum of the forces in y the sum
36:35
of the forces in y is going to be all the three weights of the people the weight of the elevator they are pointing
36:40
down that's why this is negative right plus the force of the motor the force of the motor is going up that's why this
36:47
one is positive okay we want to isolate this so we pass all of this to the other
36:52
side adding because it was subtracting like this right and times the mass of
36:58
total and time acceleration we have the acceleration is two we have that the total mass is 100 17 well
37:06
1,710 right kilogram and okay if you do this multiplication right and you add
37:12
this ones right you're going to get this that the force of the motor is this if you don't believe me you give me one
37:18
minute I did it in the calculator already and okay let me just show you really fast really fast so you can go
37:25
okay [Music]
37:33
good okay well this was the calculation it was this right okay this and you get
37:40
this okay this is the masses right this is the acceleration this is the weights
37:46
right okay and that's it when you do it that's going to be the total for that it needs the motor in order to get that
37:52
movement okay guys well I think that's it for today and okay
37:57
good okay okay thank
38:13
you
