[Music]
1:28
this
2:11
[Music]
3:00
[Music]
3:28
that
3:43
okay
3:52
Vol come
3:58
on
4:10
okay back [Music]
4:28
that
4:36
okay yeah spee
4:58
spe
5:28
okay in English perfect okay perfect then okay I
5:34
think that it's better yes because that
5:40
[Music]
5:51
way okay
5:58
okay okay okay can you see my screen yes okay perfect well basically
6:08
in basically in like in this partial right well not this partial but for this
6:14
quiz basically it was like um the project motion
6:21
right or before doing that maybe I don't know like did you cover free before I
6:27
don't know like like in the yes like in the beginning of your
6:33
semester in your in your other High School yes okay well yeah basically if
6:40
you remember Free Fall basically well just really fast remember that we always
6:46
are going to have G right is the acceleration of the gravity
6:52
right and it's always pointing downwards right yes and always remember that this
6:58
one is it's like the acceleration it's constant right that means that always we
7:05
are going to have that acceleration going down okay good it says here the
7:10
magnitude of this acceleration is 9.81 m/s square well negative because
7:16
remember like in the TR right like in
7:21
mathematics okay in mathematics we have X Y remember that we are going to have
7:28
positive right when we are talking about forward mhm and when we are talking well
7:36
and Y positive when we are talking about upward right okay remember Y is negative
7:43
when we talking downward and remember that X is negative
7:49
when we are talking back right okay yes that really
7:56
important because if you see like the theory and they are going to like the velocity is going down like of an object
8:02
is going down so you know like the Y component is going to be negative right
8:08
okay yes okay okay it says we is a motion with
8:14
constant acceleration the speed increases at a constant rate with respect to time right
8:21
okay just go okay speed and time well uh
8:27
okay for example if you remember when we have like if you remember like
8:33
acceleration the definition is Delta V over delta T and if you remember Delta V
8:39
is the rate of shange right V2 minus V1 T2 minus T1 that in physics generally
8:46
they put it like final velocity right minus initial velocity right and final
8:55
time minus initial time right basically that this one like the rate of change
9:02
right this one is the acceleration and you know that the acceleration is constant because we have that the rate
9:10
of change is always going to be the same right like in this in this BR okay
9:17
perfect let's go okay remember that when
9:22
we are talking about okay vertical launch right that if we send something upward right M we going to have an
9:31
initial velocity right yes what sign is that initial
9:37
velocity positive positive right the y direction it's going to be positive
9:43
right perfect then okay good and remember that this one is going to be
9:50
affected Always by let me [Music] see by G right by the gravity that this
9:58
one is negative so basically remember that the G is an acceleration and if it
10:06
is negative this means that it will reduce well it will diminish right b0 y
10:13
okay so for example if we have v v0 y like 50 m per second right yes positive
10:21
because it's going up this one is going to be affected every second you are
10:26
going to decrease 9 81 m per second right every second okay and if you
10:35
continue doing that there will be a point where this b y final velocity Y is going to be zero
10:44
right me per second and that's always going to be when it's at its
10:50
maximum height right yes because
10:56
instantly after that the wall will start like falling down right yes okay so remember B FY
11:05
like bfy at the maximum height is always going to be zero M met per
11:12
second okay perfect okay well the speed is zero what I told
11:19
you okay okay yeah well these formulas are
11:27
the ones we are going to use a lot in uh
11:33
vertical loue right uh well yes when we are talking about y uh in the projecti
11:40
later okay this means BF it means final
11:46
velocity right okay VI it means initial
11:54
velocity okay a it means acceleration
12:00
X it means okay distance
12:06
right well yeah because this one can be y or can it depends like when we talking about protile this
12:14
is going to be why but okay y this going to be H our height
12:20
right it's going to be G like that well yeah like this this one I didn't it but
12:26
basically this ones okay when we're talking about vertical okay well
12:34
let's see okay well maybe better projectile okay here we we have arriv
12:41
right to launching from projectile right that's the important because that's the one that we are going to
12:47
cover in this exam and well basically the only difference when we are talking
12:53
about projectile right is that in this time our velocity
13:00
right is going to have two components okay going to have the
13:09
component X right yes and it's going to have the component
13:16
y right yes okay basically like if you
13:22
remember uh for getting the components of any Vector we can for example for
13:29
getting the X component of any Vector remember okay this one is going
13:35
to have an angle right okay we take the
13:41
magnitude well of any Vector like first of any Vector this like these symbols
13:47
like the two like the two lines right it
13:52
means magude of a
14:00
Vector okay yes okay and what does it means magnitude of a vector okay the
14:08
magnitude is really related to the Pythagoras Theorem if you remember from
14:15
pythagora from geometry we have okay we have this one
14:21
is our c that is our hypotenuse right yes okay we have this that is our a that
14:29
basically the to this angle this is the adjacent angle well Adent side sorry
14:37
same side and B right is our
14:42
opposite yes okay the magnitude basically is just applying the
14:48
Pythagoras Theorem that if you remember it was c² a s plus b squ and basically
14:55
see getting the value of the hypotenuse we have to do this formula right yes
15:02
okay for uh the vectors it's kind of the same forgetting the magnitude of a
15:08
vector because if you remember a vector basically just a narrow right that has a
15:16
magnitude and a direction that basically is an angle right this is the magnitude
15:21
and this is the angle right the M the direction okay so basically we ENT in
15:29
the vectors the magnitude as the length of the vector and the angle is the
15:37
direction right yes okay this is important because okay this means that
15:43
the magnitude is going to be the two components right basically this one this
15:51
part is the X component right yes and this part is the Y component
16:00
so if we translate like the formula we see that we are going to have BX s right
16:07
cross B y² right and the square root of
16:14
that basically just applying the the Pythagoras right in physics right if you see like
16:23
equivalen is a is equivalent to BX b y is equivalent to B that's why we have
16:29
this formula and this is remember the magnitude okay then that's for the
16:36
magnitude but if we want to take now the components we have opposite like we have
16:41
the the magnitude and we want to get the components we apply the property if you
16:48
remember cosine of the angle because if you remember like really quick okay let
16:54
me put it okay cosine right of the angle
16:59
the definition is adjacent side right over Hoten so if
17:08
we want to get the Adent side that as we see here is the X component right yes we
17:15
have to do the algebra and we just have to get the Adent we multiply the cosine
17:21
of the angle times the hypotenuse and in this case hypotenuse we set sorry we
17:28
said that it was the magnitude of the vector right B for getting the X
17:35
component we do this that's why let me see we get the magnitude times the
17:40
cosine of the angle for getting BX right yes and for getting b y is going to be
17:48
almost the same but this time is the magnitude times the sign of the angle
17:54
right yes okay basic these two are really important because
18:03
okay always always always like when we are going to talk about projectile launch right we are going to
18:11
take because projectile launch let me see okay wa
18:17
projecti launch also it's called like parabolic
18:25
right uhhuh launch that basically these two are are two
18:33
Dimensions to the or well two Dimensions
18:39
movement why because the two Dimension it means that we are going to analyze
18:44
this system in the X Dimension and in the Y right in X and Y coordinates yes
18:52
that's why it's called two dimensions and it's also called parabolic because the figure right it's going to be
19:00
basically a parabola right yes M okay
19:05
perfect okay says a pro shot is moving in two Dimensions right that we said in
19:11
it f in there both vertically right you remember that Bas degree is equal to Y
19:17
right and horizontally it's equivalent to X yes and it's only under the influence
19:26
of gravity perfect okay okay yes as it says here one of the
19:34
easiest ways to understand this movement is to analyze each Dimension separately
19:43
right so that's why we are going to have formulas for
19:49
y right and formulas for X because they are two
19:58
different type of movement also why is a one with
20:04
constant acceleration and this is one with
20:11
constant velocity okay in here let me put it
20:18
there's going to be a shank in velocity because it has an acceleration
20:26
and this it that it's constant let me put there's no
20:33
sh in velocity because we said that this one
20:38
it has a constant velocity right so in next our velocity horizontal is always
20:46
going to be the same so okay basically BX is always going to be equal to the
20:52
original velocity in X right this is always going to apply for projectile
20:59
movement okay gravity will only affect okay Vertical
21:04
Velocity this means that because if you remember the G always points downwards
21:10
so basically this one it just affects to the white movement right
21:17
yes okay then let's continue okay basically
21:24
the there like two type of problems right like that is basically
21:30
the the horizontally and the vertically the
21:35
horizontally basically it's like if you are in a risk like I don't know you remember that I put like you are like
21:41
this a person right and you keep this B right and it has
21:47
only velocity in X right yes so if you
21:53
do that like okay
21:59
you are going to have that your original velocity in X right is some value but
22:05
that your original velocity Y is going to be equal to zero zero perfect why because you
22:12
don't have a component in y and also well if you want to make it like mathematically you remember b0 Y is
22:19
equal to S of the angle times the v0 okay if our b0 is something like I
22:26
don't know let's say 10 m per second second but the the angle in here what's
22:31
the angle in here if it is horizontally zero zero right so if you
22:37
remember from trigonometry the sign of zero is equal to zero Z so Z times
22:43
anything is going to be zero zero that's why in horizontal launch or when it says
22:49
like you kick a ball horizontally from a high whatever when it horizontally the v
22:54
y v0 y is going to be the original right the yes but it's going to change the
23:01
velocity because we have we always have the gravity right yes so basically yes
23:07
there will be a b y final like a BF y right final but that than to the gravity
23:16
okay okay that's horizontally in the parabolic is when you have let
23:23
me okay maybe the parab one is when you have
23:31
both right when you have horizontally and when you
23:36
have vertic velocities right original velocities
23:41
yes y b0 x right and then basically this
23:46
will have like a parabola shape right in this point is its maximum
23:54
height that basically this is where we are at our vertex if you remember from
24:01
mathematics the vertex right basically if you remember is half of the parabola
24:08
right in the vertex we are at the half of the parabola okay that's something really
24:15
important later we are going to see why but okay this says two types of
24:20
movements are involved urm that is um
24:25
uniform rinear movement yeah well that's like a definition like a book
24:33
uniform re okay
24:41
move movement right
24:46
okay and the other one is well this basically means that the velocity is
24:52
constant right BX is constant and the other one the uniform acceleration
24:59
recting movement right it means that the object has an acceleration that our
25:05
acceleration is G basically okay or everything okay velocity has two components horizontal
25:12
okay and vertical yeah we said that it has this to
25:19
okay wait let me see well yeah let me see like if the formulas if I got the
25:26
formula okay well these are like the importance
25:31
maybe basically
25:39
[Music]
25:44
okay okay well basically we are going to
25:49
have these formulas okay these formulas this
25:55
horizontal are forx and these vertical are for
26:01
y right okay yes also we have one that
26:06
is not included here but I'm going to put it here velocity final y plus
26:12
velocity velocity time time right yes okay we are
26:19
going to use these formulas for analyzing this something also really
26:25
important like maybe before the doing this like the concepts for example let me put it
26:32
reach also called range inan in Spanish alans right this
26:41
is the movement well the sorry the
26:46
distance in X right okay
26:54
okay one thing also really important is the H Max that basically means the
27:04
maximum height right yes the maximum height basically is the maximum possible
27:13
wi distance right like the maximum that it can take our Parabola basically the
27:19
top of the parabola that is our vertex right yes okay what else
27:28
okay if you remember what's the okay at H Max
27:35
right at H Max right what's the
27:41
okay okay put color okay what's our velocity in y when
27:51
we are at our maximum height zero zero perfect and well for
27:57
example if we had b0 X = to 10
28:03
m/s what value are we going to have for bfx
28:09
five what five no 10 okay if you remember
28:18
BX is always going to be constant right
28:25
yes our velocity next it will never shank so if your original velocity was
28:32
10 m/ second in all your trajectory in the X Direction your velocity is always
28:38
going to be constant that's something really important because even in the exam like later we are going to see it
28:43
like in 10 minutes but they ask you like in one question what the Velocity in the
28:52
top of the like the horizontal velocity in the top of the parabolic movement
28:57
right they ask you that in order for you to confuse because you said oh it's zero
29:02
because it's for y but that's for y but for X it's always going to be constant
29:08
right yes so it's always going to be the same value it's going to be for example for this one is going to be
29:15
10 okay well something also really important like in concept is like that's
29:23
why for example the when you have wa like a gun right M have a G right okay and you shoot to
29:33
the sky that's why it really dangerous you know like the Lost bullets right yes
29:40
the Lost bullets are really dangerous because with the same the same
29:46
velocity that you go down up is going to be exactly the same velocity that this
29:52
bullet is going to well this velocity right the original one is going to be
29:57
exactly the same when it falls down at the same height right yes okay that's
30:05
something really important so for example you can really easy know if they ask you okay for example if I shot a
30:12
bullet right I don't know I don't know like at 100 m per
30:19
second right an angle I don't know let's say of 30 right yes degrees okay if you do
30:30
that what's going to be the magnitude when the bullet goes back it's also
30:37
going to be 100 m/ second right because it's
30:42
going to be exactly the same magnitude of velocity the only thing that going to change is the direction because now it's
30:49
going to go down in the Y right yes because it's falling down but
30:56
basically the magnet is the same that's why the l bullets are really
31:01
dangerous yes okay this formula the V well this one x b IX time this time is
31:11
also called you know like this time of FR right basically is the time that an
31:23
object is in the air right
31:28
yes okay basically this means U yes is the time that the object is in there and
31:35
this one is really important because this is the one well this affect the
31:40
complete movement because okay for example something that is also from
31:47
theory is okay what do you which angle right which angle do you think that is
31:53
going to give you the maximum sorry the maximum possible height well the the M
32:00
maximum height right which one is going to give you like the best maximum
32:07
height 45 no well not for the best reach like
32:14
for the best reach yes it's 45 but for maximum height it just like
32:21
shooting for like up right like yes it's so this is going to be
32:29
90 de for getting the maximum he because well it's like logical if you shoot something up right obviously it's going
32:35
to travel more distance up right so basically you're going to get the best
32:41
possible maximum k for getting for getting the best reach right that
32:47
basically that's the X distance right the best is to show it at 45 because at
32:54
45 is like in between of x and Y right it's like in the between and doing that
33:01
if you see like the formula that it was x b IX times right yes you do that the
33:10
45 45 is going to increase well it's going to maximize the Velocity in
33:18
y both the the component Y is the one that affect the time of TR right yes so
33:27
basically 45 get you the best of both like maximizes both and if you maximize both
33:35
in a multiplication you're are going to get the best possible value right and in this case as
33:42
we are talking about the reach the range basically the best possible angle is
33:50
45 right yes okay perfect then okay we have here the exam
33:58
right that we answer with the the other version because let
34:06
me okay then okay Prof the formulas are
34:11
going to come in the exam yes like okay yeah I'm going to give you like I don't
34:18
know if you can see it I don't have like a digital version because they just gave it this one to me but they will give you
34:23
like this physical okay right okay well basically uh yeah you going to
34:32
have like okay maybe let me okay I don't have to look like okay
34:40
maybe I will I will okay wait wait me a minute yes I'm going to take a picture
34:46
of this and I'm going to put it like in the iPad let me
34:55
see do it look like
35:16
okay
35:25
way okay I'm sorry I have to answer really
35:31
fast yeah
35:50
yeah yeah sorry okay okay perfect I just have it let me share it with you you
35:57
[Music] again
36:03
[Music]
36:14
okay okay well basically these are going to be like your formulas right that you
36:20
going to have in the your exam maybe let's do some exercises I going to give you a
36:27
different exam so yeah you can can basically do this one like the one that we did in cast mod
36:34
okay let's do it okay good uh it says in parabolic
36:41
Lune the vertical velocity is z m per second right okay let's do it together maybe
36:49
okay what do you think
36:54
uh yes zer true true right perfect it's true because if you remember when we are
37:02
like in the parabola right at this maximum point the maximum height right
37:08
we are always going to have that the bfy is going to be Z point zero yes right
37:14
perfect okay next one the time that it takes to reach the maximum he in
37:21
parabolic parabolic Lun is half of the total time you remember we said that
37:28
this was the vertex right and that the vertex is always in the middle of the
37:33
par so basically what do you think in this one true true
37:40
perfect okay next one the horizontal velocity in parabolic lunch has an
37:47
acceleration in ofus 9.81 false false right because it says
37:55
horizontal velocity right yes so basically this is going to be false
38:01
because this will be just correct if we have vertical right yes but as we have
38:09
horizontal yeah it's false okay when for
38:14
when an object is thrown diagonally remember the diagonally means like the diagonal right M the vertical velocity
38:23
never changes what do you
38:30
think false false perfect because it says Vertical
38:38
Velocity remember that the vertical velocity is the one that changes yes the one that is constant
38:45
that never changes is the horizontal right or DX right BX is the
38:53
one that is constant perfect okay continue let's
38:58
continue the vertical velocity is negative when an object is moving
39:03
downward true true right because if you remember from mathematics we were saying
39:10
that remember that y positive up y negative down right yes so for Vertical
39:19
Velocity yes this will be true well okay let's continue it says during the
39:26
trajectory of a parabolic lunch right the horizontal velocity okay let's read them what do
39:34
you think a it says change its magnitude and direction we are talking about horizontal velocity does it change it
39:42
magnitude no no so this one cannot be okay letter B shangus is magnitude
39:51
but maintains its direction the horizontal velocity
39:57
no no perfect okay letter C changes its direction but maintains its
40:07
magnitude no no because if you remember if you send something like in this
40:12
direction it will always go forward right it will not change the direction
40:19
it will not go backward like suddenly no it will not do that it will always maintain the direction so this means
40:25
that the only possible one it says maintains the same direction and magnitude right so this is letter
40:33
D perfect okay number two it says the
40:39
following drawing shows the trajectory of a toy cannonball at which point will
40:45
the horizontal velocity be 0 m/ second okay seven d t d right
40:54
never why no t i no horizontal yes d d it's never
41:02
because remember that we have right an original velocity in X and if this is
41:09
constant right yes this will never going to be zero like in any point we will
41:16
have the same BX so basically this will never be zero
41:23
that's why it says never right yes okay
41:30
perfect let's continue okay a football is thrown in
41:36
parabolic launch right why the vertical velocity at the
41:42
maximum height what do you
41:48
zero perfect it's zero right because we said that at the top of the parabola at
41:54
the vertex right then velocity is going to be zero
41:59
perfect four in parabolic launch we can state that what do you think in that one okay
42:07
let's read them a acceleration changes in the first half of the P what do you
42:13
think in the second part yes perfect no because yeah okay first of all the
42:20
acceleration doesn't shange right mhm okay letter b the horizontal velocity is
42:29
constant yes yes perfect so this will be B
42:37
right perfect I don't know why it move okay five let's read the five it says
42:44
when an object is thrown forward right basically
42:53
forward I don't know like this right when thr forward
42:59
with a horizontal velocity right the horizontal velocity right of 24 m/
43:08
second from the roof of a building right imagine like you have okay like this
43:14
roof of a building right yes what can we say about its Vertical Velocity and
43:20
horizontal velocity okay let's read them it's very
43:26
letter a is vertical velocity and horizontal velocity are both
43:32
positive okay first of all BX what sign do you think that it has if it positive
43:38
positive right and B Y which sign negative negative perfect so we can
43:46
well we can say this one no but we can SK Skip and say this one it says it's Vertical Velocity it's negative remember
43:54
that this is vertical right why vertical and X is horizontal right yes
44:04
so basically will be Lea what do you think which lettera
44:10
c c yes yeah letter C right yes okay it's
44:20
Vertical Velocity is negative right but its horizontal velocity is positive
44:25
right right perfect okay great let's continue with
44:32
the progs right okay in here let's take this
44:39
[Music] one
44:50
[Music] yes
44:56
[Music]
45:04
okay right okay we have the formulas in here
45:09
right yes okay first of all let's see the problem well like what I told you
45:15
like your classmates like the like if I have to put like a step for doing a prr
45:22
of this type right basically something that is really useful is to
45:28
always get viix and VI i y right the original
45:35
velocities the components of these ones something really useful number two
45:42
it's to get the okay what are
45:49
they asking you
45:54
right okay they are asking you for example total time and range well in the
46:00
pr it says a speed is thrown at 15 m/ second horizontally from the roof right
46:07
65 M building how long will it take to reach the
46:13
ground and well how long basically this is the time right total time
46:19
and what is the range is this one right yes range was
46:28
the a yes also it is the X maximum right
46:34
the X distance yes
46:40
okay in the parabola let me put it in the parabola
46:48
right okay basically the reach the range is this distance right
46:57
yes okay so basically that the range
47:02
right in what are they asking you okay
47:07
well sorry step number two is what they are asking you step three it will
47:13
be what data do
47:20
you have right yes okay number four is
47:27
like look for an equation
47:35
right that has both like has two and three this means that it has what they
47:42
are asking you and what data do you have but remember that you can just have
47:49
one unknown right yes because remember in
47:55
mathematics they tell you like you for every equation right MH you need one
48:04
unknown because if not you cannot solve that equation yes okay so basically we
48:11
have this and okay so okay that's like the step for solving any problem of this
48:19
type now let's apply it to this problem okay it says I Fe is from 50 m/ second
48:31
horizontally okay H Fe is from 50 m horizontally right yes from the roof at
48:41
65 or well from a 65 M building right yes so basically what is the the 50 m/
48:50
second horizontally the velocity horizontal
48:55
horizontal the BX right yes is 50 m/ second now what's the value of b y well
49:04
original velocity original velocity zero perfect it's zero right because it's
49:11
horizontal and also like if you do it like mathematically is because the sign
49:16
of zero because our angle is zero when we are talking about horizontal right
49:21
yes is going to be zero okay perfect we have that let me
49:30
okay perfect and okay that's BX b y okay
49:36
we also have what is this value a 65 M building the height the height perfect
49:44
so basically this is height 65 M right yes okay so
49:51
basically we have okay that was like the first part that it was getting the I
49:58
well BX and b y right number two what are they asking you they are asking us
50:04
for what time and range time and range
50:09
perfect and number three what data do you have okay we saw that we have well
50:15
we could get BX b y and we also can get the age right yes okay so now number
50:24
four like look for like in the question that you have let's see which ones can
50:29
we use okay we have for example in this part let's see like this part
50:36
right okay we have for example okay first of all let's try to solve total
50:42
time the time so let's look for the question that have time okay let me okay
50:49
this one doesn't have time so no this one has time yes yes this this one
50:55
doesn't have time no this one has time yes okay this one has time yes okay so
51:05
we have to look in one two or three but now also we have to see what value do we
51:12
have like what data right yes okay we said that we have we don't have the let
51:19
me put it we don't have the final velocity in y no no we have the initial velocity in
51:29
y right yes we always have the G right
51:36
yes do we have the time no no so this one has two unknowns right one equation
51:44
so basically we cannot use this one right because we need just one
51:50
unnown yes okay let's go with the next one
51:56
okay do we have the height yes yes do we have the original
52:02
velocity in y yes perfect do we have the
52:07
G yes yes the only one that we don't have is the T
52:14
right okay so basically one unknown one equation so
52:21
basically we can use this one right yes okay just for you to see the next one we
52:29
cannot also use it because we don't have the final velocity and the time so it's
52:35
going to be two unknown so basically the one that we're going to use is this purle one right yes okay so basically H
52:44
equals b i y time +2 of GT s okay let's replace the
52:54
values okay well I will do it here and later I will make it smaller but
53:00
okay okay let's replace the values the value of the height what was
53:05
it 65 65 right
53:10
okay biy what do we said that it was zero zero right zero times time right
53:21
plus2 of G well G it was - 9.81 right
53:28
yes t² okay well 0 * time this is going to
53:33
be equal to zero right yes so basically here we are just going to do algebra the
53:40
65 equal to one well half of 9.81 if you do it in your calculator right is
53:48
4.95 t² right yes okay and now we just
53:53
have to do algebra we pass dividing right there well this
53:59
one in fact the the height is negative because if we start from zero right if
54:05
this is our zero if when we fall right when we fall back this distance it's negative right
54:13
yes so it's going to be - 65 - 65 byus
54:20
4.95 right and if you remember from mathematics when we have something square right how do we pass it to the
54:27
other side with the square root the square root perfect right so basically we are
54:33
going to do the square root of that okay can you tell me like do you have your calculator with
54:39
you yes what I did first I is it wrong if I first take out the square root of
54:48
4.95 and then the answer that divided yes yes it's wrong because
54:55
you remember from mathematics right what's the order of operations the first
55:00
one like the most important one see the parentheses right yes then is the power
55:05
and the square root well the squares the of yeah like Roots yeah like cubic
55:12
square whatever no okay this like the first one this is the second one the
55:17
third one is multiplication and division right and number four is addition and
55:23
subtraction right and well last one if you remember is from left to right
55:32
right yes that's for operations but for
55:38
the Spees no like for solving is the opposite way this is the last one
55:45
right okay okay this is important because okay
55:53
if you see these two well these are multiplying right yes
56:00
okay well this is multiplying to this one so in order to get this one we first do the
56:08
multiplication and then we do the square roots or the powers right yes basically
56:15
first we have to pass this one dividing and then we can do the square root okay
56:22
that's why because like for solving is the opposite way so yes like you first
56:28
have to divide and then the square root okay
56:33
okay let me do
56:44
it it gave me 3.64 seconds okay
56:52
3 64 right second yes perfect okay let me try to make this
57:01
one
57:08
[Music]
57:19
small okay that's good now let's
57:25
do we have one value now we have to go for the range how do you imagine that
57:31
you can solve for the range where do you see the range
57:36
basically well first of all why is the range it's h the distance in X the
57:45
distance in X right yes so we have to look remember like in
57:50
here what are they asking you the distance of x okay so let's look
57:56
equation that have the distance of X the only one that I see that it has distance of X is this one
58:04
right yes like if you see there is no like distance of X in any of the other
58:09
equations so basically is that one okay so we are going to use that one let's
58:16
see do we have the Velocity
58:22
next yes yes right do we have the time we just got it
58:29
right yes so basically we are just going to do algebra right the spe right and we
58:37
are going to get that DX is BX multiply by Delta time right so basically we are
58:44
just going to multiply 15 times the time that we just got 3.64 right yes so what
58:53
do you have what do you get you do that 54.6 okay perfect this is going to be
59:01
and it's in meters right yes exactly it is in meters because we are talking
59:08
about distance right we are talking about range yes perfect let me just
59:16
okay for this new [Music]
59:23
one
59:37
okay okay well good okay now let's do number two right
59:46
yes okay it says I stone is from
59:51
horizontally right yes from the roof of a 45 M building and reaches a range of
1:00:02
70 MERS right yes how long will it take
1:00:08
you remember how long basically the time right will it take to reach the ground that basically that the total
1:00:15
time and what is the horizontal velocity right yes okay well basically
1:00:25
in this one let's like do the steps that I show
1:00:31
you let me just copy and
1:00:42
paste okay the steps right MH
1:00:48
okay it says let me
1:00:53
see does it look better like that or yes it's better thank you okay let me
1:01:02
just bit Yeah okay it says a stone is found
1:01:11
horizontally right from the roof 45 Ms okay first of all what is this the 45 M
1:01:20
building ER the height height perfect
1:01:25
the height is 45 M right well in here
1:01:31
basically says the range right
1:01:37
is 70 M right
1:01:43
okay right okay if we try to do like the first step the B we don't know them we
1:01:52
don't know it right no that's why it's asking you why the horizontal velocity so we cannot get this one but can we get
1:02:00
the [Music]
1:02:07
viy what do you think yes yes perfect because here
1:02:15
says horizontally basically what's going to be our
1:02:20
angle zero zero right and if you remember the sign of zero is going to
1:02:26
give us zero so basically this is going to be zero zero right meters per second
1:02:34
okay perfect now let's look like the steps okay what are they asking you
1:02:40
they're asking you okay first the total time so let's go and see the formulas
1:02:46
that have total time remember that the total time it depends just in of Y right
1:02:53
it depends just of Y y yes that why we are going to look in the Y section okay
1:03:00
okay let's look for the one that has total time this one has total time this
1:03:06
one has total well time and this one has time right yes three basically you're
1:03:13
going to see that this really close to the last problem right it was almost
1:03:18
it's going to be almost exactly the same for the total time why because
1:03:25
same again we don't have this value and we don't have this value we have two unknown so we cannot use that one right
1:03:33
yes also in the last one we don't have the final and also the time so we cannot
1:03:38
use this one but in here we have the initial the height the G the only one
1:03:45
that we don't have is the time so it's one on on one equation so basically we are going to use this one yes okay H
1:03:54
right right it says 45 45 yes perfect
1:03:59
let's replace it 45 M right equals to viy VI Y what we
1:04:07
said that it was Zero 0 * time is going to be zero right okay cos 12 of G right
1:04:18
yes remember that this is negative right because we were talking that we started from zero right and when we fall like
1:04:25
this distance is negative okay so basically kind of the same we're going
1:04:30
to divide 45 divided my 4.95 right and this we are going to
1:04:38
get the square R right yes okay
1:04:43
basically we do that and what do we get it's
1:04:50
3.29 seconds let me check check 3 point what
1:04:59
029 okay perfect
1:05:05
329 right seconds right yes perfect now let's go for the horizontal
1:05:16
velocity okay now let's look horizontal it means that we are going to use this
1:05:21
part right yes of the
1:05:26
where do we have okay we have the Velocity right here and we just got the
1:05:33
time so basically for getting the value that they well sorry sorry no we don't
1:05:39
have the Velocity right is the one that we are going to get but we just got
1:05:45
where they give us the 70 M right basically this one right yes and we just got the time
1:05:54
right that is 3.29 so for getting the VX is really easy just making the division right yes
1:06:03
we are going to divide what between what 70 divided by
1:06:09
3.29 Perfect what do you get if you do
1:06:15
that 23 1 1 0 perfect
1:06:22
23.11 01 meters horizontal velocity what meters
1:06:29
per second meters per second perfect now okay we just solve number
1:06:35
two really good let's go with number three right yes the last one okay it
1:06:46
says a football player let me
1:06:53
okay
1:07:10
okay it says a football player throws the ball at 20 m per second at an angle
1:07:16
of 55 degrees right yes what is the range and what is the maximum he okay
1:07:23
they are go basically the range and maximum height first of all I told you like it's
1:07:30
really useful to get always like the components viix and
1:07:36
viy right okay viix basically we said that
1:07:42
it was cosine of the angle times the magnitude right okay give me the this
1:07:50
one is going to be the cosine of what
1:07:55
of 55 55 perfect right and times the
1:08:03
velocity what's the value of the Velocity 20 20 m per second perfect
1:08:10
right okay yes okay later we calculate how for y for y why is the
1:08:19
formula sin times the angle no SC of the angle times the velocity right so
1:08:27
basically we are going to get the sin of
1:08:32
what oh 55 55 right times
1:08:38
what 20 20 perfect okay now we get both
1:08:43
let
1:08:52
me okay let's do it can you do it withing
1:08:58
your calculator the first one yes I got
1:09:03
11472 m per second 11 4.47 right yes second and the second one
1:09:12
did you do it yes 16.38 meters per second perfect
1:09:20
16.38 m per second right yes okay that's really good okay then
1:09:30
okay let's see the maximum height or the
1:09:35
range can we get the range directly okay the range if you remember
1:09:42
is this one right yes okay no we cannot we cannot because we
1:09:48
have two unknowns right yes we don't know the range and we don't know
1:09:54
the time so we cannot use this one yet yet okay so maybe let's go with the
1:10:00
maximum height right yes okay the maximum height if you remember right
1:10:09
that's why is really important like the definition the concept how how do you imagine that you
1:10:16
can get the maximum height
1:10:21
with the third
1:10:28
formula yes no yeah you can use that one also you can use um which one the other
1:10:36
one that for example you can use any of these two like the one that you said
1:10:42
like the third formula right also you can use this
1:10:47
one yes okay why because okay let's
1:10:56
see Okay then if you remember right
1:11:01
then okay we don't have the height but do we have the final velocity
1:11:08
in y yes what is the final velocity when
1:11:15
it's at its maximum height zero perfect we have this one do
1:11:21
we have the original velocity yes we just calculated yes okay right yes
1:11:30
okay wait [Music]
1:11:36
wait yeah both okay
1:11:41
[Music]
1:11:47
wait okay wait okay no well we cannot use those yet right so sorry I make a
1:11:54
mistake right we cannot use this one yet right because we will have two
1:12:00
unknowns but yes we can use for example it was this one the one that I
1:12:06
tried to say yeah this one because we have the final velocity in y that is equal
1:12:12
to zero right zero the initial velocity that we just calculated that is this one
1:12:19
right and we always have G yes okay
1:12:24
basically we can like substitute right the final velocity in y is equal to zero
1:12:31
right okay the initial velocity in why we just calculated that is
1:12:37
16.38 right yes per second plus G G isus
1:12:44
9.81 m/s squar right time T so basically we do the
1:12:51
algebra and we pass - 16.38 right divided by -
1:12:59
9.81 right and we get what do we get you have your
1:13:06
calculator with you yes it's 1
1:13:12
67 perfect we have 1.67 seconds right yes okay perfect
1:13:21
that's the time at when we are at our maximum K
1:13:30
right okay now now we have the time now yes we
1:13:37
can use this formula the one that I was telling you yeah sorry I I like Skip One
1:13:43
Step but yes now we have the final the
1:13:48
initial and the time right so basically we can get the maximum the height is
1:13:55
going to be 12 of what the final velocity y zero right yes first what the
1:14:04
initial velocity we just calculated that it was 16.38 right yes times the time that we
1:14:13
just calculated that it was 1.67 right yes so basically if you put this
1:14:21
in your calculator you are going to
1:14:29
where 13.78 68
1:14:35
1368 what yes meters meters perfect okay
1:14:42
that's really good but now let's think a little bit about the parabolic movement
1:14:48
right yes if you remember when we are at our maximum
1:14:53
height right we are at half of the parabola
1:15:00
right yes and we said that the same time that it takes to go up is the same time
1:15:08
that it takes to go down right yes so basically this is just half of the time
1:15:16
of the compete Parabola okay what do you imagine that we have to do in order to get the
1:15:24
time multiply by two multiply by two perfect so the total time right total
1:15:31
right is going to be two times what
1:15:36
1.67 perfect so in that case we are going to get the total time that what is
1:15:45
[Music] it
1:15:51
it's 3.34 perfect thank you okay seconds right
1:15:58
okay yes now we have the time and what else do we have okay let
1:16:05
me see for getting the range okay we have
1:16:12
the time and we have the original velocity right the
1:16:17
VX one so basically we just have to do the algebra the spe right
1:16:24
and we are going to get that the range right equal to maybe another color BX
1:16:32
multipli by Delta time and BX is equal
1:16:39
to BX is 11.47 perfect and what is our
1:16:47
time 3.34 3.34 so can you please do it
1:16:58
yes 38 Point 31 perfect so we get
1:17:06
38 31 what unit the range meters
1:17:14
meters perfect then when but in I have a
1:17:19
question yeah yeah in the uh in the first problem why didn't we multiply the
1:17:28
time times two okay because okay let me see like
1:17:35
the figure okay here this is the perfect because if you see this is like half of
1:17:41
the parabola right so basically we es skip we ignore
1:17:49
this part because that part like never happened when when we are talking about horizontal launch we start from here we
1:17:58
don't start from here okay that's why we just take half
1:18:03
of the parabola right when we are talking about parabolic we start from here so in here
1:18:11
we are going to take both parts of the parabola right like the whole
1:18:17
Parabola yes basically it's because of that so only in parabolic launches you
1:18:25
double the time yes if they ask you for the the
1:18:31
reach right just for the reach because well like for your classmate because I
1:18:38
teach them like maybe more deep I teach them for example that for getting the VX
1:18:44
right any time is basically the b0x
1:18:50
multipied by the time of right how do you get the time of fact well
1:18:56
this like like above the I think that the level that they teach you well at Le
1:19:01
the exam that they put right here but for example the time of f right you get
1:19:09
it most of the time from this
1:19:15
formula there this one right yes okay
1:19:21
now you're going to see or you you still don't have like access to ca right yes no okay well because I left them a
1:19:29
homework like if you go tomorrow I'm going to solve some of the problems in the in the class right okay because
1:19:37
generally I I well I put like homeworks above the level of the exams right in
1:19:42
order that you study really hard and you get really good grades right okay but with
1:19:51
basically this is well this is a square right okay if you remember from
1:19:57
mathematics the for well the quadratic equation it has this formula right a x²
1:20:04
+ b x + C right okay if you remember
1:20:10
okay a is the one that is multiplying our unknown square
1:20:17
right B is the constant that is multiplying our unknown to the one power
1:20:24
right and C basically just the constant that is not multiplying any X
1:20:30
right yes okay basically well the complete formula for this one will be H
1:20:37
equals h0 plus b0 t plus 12 G t²
1:20:47
right okay so let's see like the equivalences because also this is both
1:20:52
of them are quadratic equations right yes the equivalency okay a is the one
1:20:58
that is multiplying our unknown square right in here this is our unknown Square
1:21:03
the time right yes what is multiplying the Time
1:21:09
Square G one one2 g one2 g perfect so
1:21:14
basically our a is 12 G right yes okay
1:21:21
our B the is the one that is multiplying our unnown to the one basically in here
1:21:27
this is T right yes what is multiplying our T original velocity perfect original
1:21:35
velocity initial velocity right this is B
1:21:41
right perfect and C C well basically if you remember for well for applying
1:21:48
something that is called if you remember what is the general formula do you remember like the general
1:21:54
formula for solving quadratic equations it's the one that's negative B
1:22:01
plus minus the square root of b^ 2 minus 4 a
1:22:06
c divided by 2 a perfect the general formula well the square root of this I
1:22:13
forget it okay this one is going to give us two values right yes that's why the
1:22:20
plus minus okay
1:22:25
basically for doing this general formula we have to equal zero right this has to
1:22:32
be of this shape okay so
1:22:38
basically what do you think that is going to be our C it's going to be h0 minus H right we
1:22:46
have to pass this one to this side and if this is adding this will pass
1:22:52
subtracting right yes so
1:22:58
basically okay we get this three right and like for getting like any value
1:23:06
because you can get you can get the X position in any value like you don't have to limit to the to this one right
1:23:14
you can get the X in here you can get the X in here in whatever position you
1:23:20
want right MH this is really useful because for example I don't know like
1:23:26
for sending magees right or I don't know like whatever like a shot or something
1:23:32
in you can say okay at this time in in which position is going to be this
1:23:39
projectile right in which XY position you can get it really easy for example
1:23:46
the X position if you remember the formula well not just remember it's in here
1:23:52
right right this is the formula the v0x we get it from the
1:23:58
beginning because it's just calculating the magnitude right yes one what the
1:24:03
time of f it depends right on this stuff right yes if you want to know the EXP
1:24:11
position at any height like if you want to know for example I don't know let let's say this height
1:24:17
right this height is 20 M 12 m 12 Ms you just input this 12 Ms in here
1:24:28
right the h z you take it maybe a zero like that right and with that using this
1:24:36
the general formula you are going to get one well two times of five why do you
1:24:43
get two times of five because if you see these two positions right yes are
1:24:51
equivalent in y they have the same kind right H1 and H2 they are
1:24:59
equal basically they will have time one and time two right they are going to be
1:25:06
different the times but the heights are going to be the same that's why we get two values
1:25:15
we get one value that is before the parabola and we get a second value that
1:25:20
is after the half of the Parabola right yes okay basically that's why we can
1:25:27
solve well we solve this general formula and we are going to get time one or time
1:25:34
two yes and now like you can decide okay maybe I want the first time if you do
1:25:40
that right okay sorry this was a mistake this is no v x this is X right okay X right
1:25:52
yes okay and we depend of time like function of time okay in here we we we
1:25:59
had this from the beginning and we calculated this from the general formula so we input any of these two values and
1:26:07
will give us okay this x position right or this first point and okay a
1:26:16
second sorry it wasn't here okay a second X right we are going to get this
1:26:25
X2 this X1 right mhm yeah basically like you don't
1:26:32
have to limit to get the range like basically High School physics that's a typical problem that they put but in
1:26:39
reality with the same formulas you can get any value right you can get the X in
1:26:46
any position of the parabola kind of the same like the equivalent if they give you an X right you can get the height in
1:26:55
any point just like in substituting this formula right and getting the time of
1:27:01
right and then the time of right you substitut it in the same formula right
1:27:06
yes and you get the height like if they give you X you can get y if they gave
1:27:12
you y you can get X right yes
1:27:18
okay and basically that's like you don't have to limit yourself like
1:27:24
tomorrow you are going to see like we don't have time right now but tomorrow I'm going to explain a program that is
1:27:31
more interesting that basically let me like for you to give you like a preview
1:27:38
okay for example you have a gun right yes and you know that this gun for
1:27:44
example shoots at 100 m per second right yes and you want to hit
1:27:51
exactly
1:28:02
okay a point right like I don't know you want to hit exactly this coordinate
1:28:08
right that is an x y coordinate so for example you want to shoot something that
1:28:15
is 100 m horizontal from you right MH
1:28:20
and it's I don't know like a a height of 20 M right yes we are going to see
1:28:26
tomorrow that there is a Formula that you can see it even in Wikipedia it's like a kind of hard for but like you
1:28:33
don't have to learn it you just have to know how to input the value right there is a Formula that it will tell you which
1:28:42
angle you have to shoot that gun in order to hit exactly that point
1:28:50
right okay really useful because that's something that you can use like a lot in like well like in real life you are like
1:28:57
engineer and want to for example a projectile right you have like a gun and you say Okay I want to shoot exactly
1:29:03
that point right with these calculations you can know okay I have to I have this gun that
1:29:10
I know that it fires at 100 m per second so I know like okay with this angle I
1:29:16
will exactly shoot that point right yes so yeah basically we're going to do that
1:29:21
because like part of the homework yeah I put like in the homework like problems harder than the one that you get in the
1:29:29
exams know that you get good but still like well you have to upload it so
1:29:34
okay but yeah tomorrow we are going to see like three problems like of this
1:29:40
level like are a little bit above the level of the exam okay so tomorrow what we're seeing
1:29:47
will not come in the exam no no no no no no okay like the the thing that we saw
1:29:53
right now is like the perfect for the examp okay like the one that we are
1:29:58
going to see tomorrow are above the level okay it's for the H word because it's the H word like basically I'm going
1:30:04
to solve the H word yeah okay yes okay
1:30:11
well good okay
