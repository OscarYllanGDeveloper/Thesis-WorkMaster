0:22
okay okay guys let's start we're going to do some prrams right okay that's the homework
0:30
that you have to do right okay so okay let's see right as I told you right is
0:39
we are going to have some of these problems right and just like this
0:44
remember that we were seeing in the week like some problems where you have these
0:50
two ropes right we are going to have two tensions right and we are going to have this tension right okay in here is
0:57
really Direct in comparison with the others because in here they are giving us already the weight 200 newon we don't
1:03
have to calculate it calculate right it will be just masstimes G but in here they are already
1:10
giving us that the weight is 200 Newton we know because it's Newton right Newton is a force right so it's not mass right
1:19
it's Newtons remember that mass is kilograms Newtons is a force okay good okay let's see all the point that we
1:25
have okay the second one
1:34
okay the second one is also in equilibrium right the first one is in equilibrium remember that equilibrium is
1:40
when the sum of the forces the sum of the forces is equal to
1:45
zero right okay good okay the sum of the
1:51
forces is equal to zero that's when we have equilibrium
1:58
right okay good okay this is in equilibrium the second one is also in
2:03
equilibrium because let's read the problem it says broke right of 200 Newtons right is resting over another
2:11
right without friction that it has right an angle of 30° this block is um join
2:18
with a rope right that happens to be in a right this without friction okay in
2:24
the exterior of the plane and it goes join to a second br as I told you right
2:31
you can have different masses the important thing is that these are going to have the same acceleration as I have
2:38
told you before guys remember that that's why we are going to the first step is always to draw right remember
2:45
okay let me see okay the first step is to draw right the free body
2:51
diagram then scen body diagram right
2:56
body diagram as I told you right the name tell you the half of the answer right okay
3:04
good as the name tell you the half of the answer guys so you are going to have
3:10
right that if you have two bodies right you have to draw two free
3:21
body okay this one this object is being affected by three forces right that is
3:26
the normal force that is the weight and is the tens right okay this right okay
3:34
okay something really important is that this tension should be the
3:42
same okay that's really important okay let's analyze it in here right we have
3:48
that this normal force is going to be remember that
3:54
we that and remember that we are not going to use this okay we can use this angle but remember that if we use this
4:00
angle instead of using um cosine 4X and S 4 y we are going to do the opposite we
4:07
are going to use for X we are going to use S and for um y we are going to use
4:14
cosine right okay good okay so we have that option or we have the second option
4:21
that is subtracting to 90° this angle right and that's going to give us 60 and
4:26
if we work with 60 we can use the normal f cosine with X and sign with Y right as
4:33
you decide it's the same okay good and that we are going to do that in order to
4:39
get the tension okay or the opposite way we can also get the W2 let's see what
4:44
they are giving okay giv us that the
4:56
weight okay and it has a 30° is okay okay no they are sing of the we too okay
5:03
good so we are going to solve right for the tension we can get the tension we
5:08
can see right that this force is a normal force should be equal to the what
5:16
to the weight in y right in order to
5:27
cancel okay so this should be
5:42
equal so we are going to get the in order to get the why is important
5:49
the this second object right has the way
5:58
andion
6:21
okay okay good okay well friction H
6:28
well
6:35
okay okay friction forces
6:41
okay like in real life right we have friction forces right you can see it
6:46
every day like for example just just do this with your hands you have friction for
6:58
right the winds right they have a friction right that's why for example
7:03
for the people who drive like when you are driving right if you have an automatic card you can
7:11
like and you're going to see that for some moments you are going to have like the same velocity that happens thanks to
7:17
the first low remember that you're going to continue with the same velocity the only thing right
7:28
that right Fric forf
7:37
right right they are friction forces that happen because for example
7:50
mop microscopic right not this the surfaces are not like
7:58
completely not perfect so they have
8:06
like and also this one for example right like if you see it microscopic
8:13
green right
8:18
so so as they are happening to the each other
8:28
right
8:40
[Music]
8:55
I can
9:08
[Music] good okay guys that's what fiction looks
9:16
like like in microscopic level right you have like this right that the surfaces are not perfect right okay because as it
9:24
says friction occurred because of surface roughness right okay if you see right right the surfaces are not perfect
9:31
and they generate friction right okay like this or this right that's like what
9:36
it happens in real life so okay we're going to see that the friction right it
9:43
has a formula really re see and yes reallyy that it depends on the normal
9:50
force that's why also is really important the normal force okay the normal force guys okay we're going to
9:57
have that well we have we have two type of friction okay we have a static
10:09
friction and we have thetic
10:15
friction okay
10:20
basically they have the same formula the only different thing is that they have different coefficients okay let's see
10:27
the static friction
10:35
friction right okay and this is equal
10:54
toce F static friction
11:03
okay good the MU is friction
11:16
coefficient static fiction static
11:21
[Music]
11:27
coefficient okay and the NF is the normal
11:37
force
11:44
okay okay that's the normal force right normal force the static friction and the
11:50
um okay
11:57
for okay good so this is the formula right
12:07
Perfection okay good right okay good so you have the
12:16
static friction right that is equal to this this is a
12:27
coefficient in real life they it
12:41
right right that's depending on that so
12:50
okay okay good so basically um that's what we have right and we are going to
12:57
get something really important from friction right is the concept that the
13:03
friction force is always always always
13:10
opposite to the
13:27
movement
13:57
always
14:27
okay
14:34
we can see right in the matics that the normal force right is going to increase
14:40
right well if the normal force increases also increases this one obiously that
14:46
the coefficient
14:57
increases okay good so that's logic right okay and
15:07
well we have the static and we have
15:27
the
15:39
maybe when you were little kids like if you were like primary
15:55
schools you can put it like a pencil you can put it right but if you like start moving
16:04
it right that happens because exactly the kinetic friction right the kinetic
16:10
friction is lower than the static
16:16
friction okay good okay and this is really important because we are going to
16:22
use it when there are progr that tell you that they have friction you have to include the friction in the progr so for
16:29
example it was because of this okay in here they are telling us that you have a friction coefficient that is static okay
16:37
this means okay as we see it in the picture right in here we have the weight
16:45
right okay the normal force this weight remember that we are going to rotate the
16:50
angle right so this weight is going to have remember a w y a component Y in W
16:57
and the component X in right we are going to have also right the normal
17:03
force and this is telling us okay okay it's telling tell me the minimum angle
17:09
that the object must have to stay in equilibrium okay this problem is a little bit harder right because you have
17:14
to get the angle you don't have to get this you have to get right what angle is
17:19
going to make that is possible this right okay good okay uh so in order to
17:27
do it right you have to calculate the friction Force okay the friction force
17:33
is going to be right the normal force multiply by the coefficient right okay
17:39
and the normal force is going to be equal to w y right yes okay so you have
17:46
to translate all of this and make the isolation good maybe later we are going
17:53
okay so you start seeing this okay what else
17:59
okay well this one is from Dynamic this one is even more interesting right this one is even more interesting because in
18:05
here right we have the following system right where M1 and M2 we have two masses
18:11
guys we have two masses right and we have a force right and we also have
18:16
friction so maybe this is like the hardest problem that you can have in your exam yes most likely this is like
18:23
the top okay that's like the hardest thing
18:30
that you can have in your exam right okay this program for okay in here right
18:36
it says we have the following system where a mass of 120 kilog and mass two
18:41
of 5 kilogram if the force right is 10 Newtons and we have this friction right
18:47
with this angle okay tell me the acceleration of M1 okay and second one
18:53
tell me one mu one that will make the system completely static okay okay
19:02
yes but this is like the level that you can expect right okay from your exam
19:08
like the hardest problem okay good so okay remember that okay we have two
19:13
masses right there we're going to have two ways right okay remember that it's the first step is always what is the
19:19
first step to draw the free body diagram
19:25
right okay
19:33
okay free body di how many Val we have two so we are going to draw the two
19:38
diags okay let's see how many forces we have we have the force that is pushing it we have the
19:47
weight we have the normal
19:53
force and we have the friction we have the friction because they are telling us
19:59
that they have friction coefficient when they give you friction coefficient you going to know that you have friction
20:05
okay remember that the friction right is always opposite right to the movement
20:10
this object is being pushed to the right and also has this weight in X right so
20:17
the object is going to move to the right as it's going to move to the right we are going to do that the friction right
20:22
force is going to be in this way right okay so the friction right is going to
20:29
be this right okay good okay it's going to be kinetic okay good so we're going
20:36
to have that okay so and they are telling us right that okay the
20:43
acceleration of M1 okay also we are going to have another
20:49
force that is the okay thisor okay is the
20:57
tension we have the tension of the r okay so we
21:02
have the tension the force right that is going to subract well in why we know
21:09
that this one is in equilibrium and
21:16
yeah in is not in X is not in equilibrium right because this one is
21:21
moving okay good we have a t and a force right that is going to subract this okay
21:28
so in order to get the T the T has to be right the the is going
21:36
to be the same in this r that in this R right
21:57
okay
22:26
body
22:56
okay
23:07
this object is trying to move to the what to the right yes okay so as he is
23:16
trying to move to the right we have that the friction force is also going to be in what direction is going to be the
23:22
opposite right the friction force is to be
23:31
right yes to this side so for example in this object we have four forces right
23:38
yes okay
23:56
good
24:06
okay kilog 20 kilog MP by the G
24:11
9.81 right okay
24:18
good okay and okay that's going to be the weight one the weight
24:24
two right is going to be for example
24:36
what by 9.81 right m/s squar good okay
24:43
that's weight one that's weight two right okay what another forces can we get really easy the normal force we can
24:49
get it really easy right normal force one for example normal force one right
24:56
this object one normal force of the object one right is going to be equal
25:03
well we can get it really
25:19
directly good okay and that's how you start doing okay for example the friction forceing one
25:26
fk1 right how can you get it really
25:53
easy that's skk one right so now we got this this this right and we already they
26:00
already gave us the force right since the beginning so we can calculate right
26:06
the tension right okay good and with this one also we can do now for the
26:12
second part right the normal force right in two is going to be equal to what the
26:19
W2 in y right the W2 in y we can get it because they are telling us that the
26:25
angle is 50 right so we are going to right well this is
26:41
50 okay you do that right and you are going to get this normal
26:55
force by the two right and that's going to be to this side right and then we can
27:01
calculate the tension right okay now that we
27:20
have right okay we got the masses right we just isolate right for the masses and
27:26
we are going to get the acceleration remember that acceleration should be the equal for
27:31
both right and that's how you do it that's how you do this and then right
27:38
okay for example now you change the problem number two you are going to get
27:45
you're going to shame this you're going to ignore this and you're going to make which value of mu1 will make this Force
27:52
big enough in order to cancel this two so if this two cancel this
27:58
object is going going to be static right it's going to be um yes static so
28:03
basically that's what you have to do and that's going to be like the hardest hardest problem that you can get right
28:08
in your exam just basically and
28:14
basically with that is all that you're going to see about forces right uhuh I
28:19
think it's a really good problem this for so you can practice a lot because
28:24
with that one basically you're applying everything you're in static you're applying
28:30
um yes well basically the second Newton Law you're applying the friction forces
28:36
you
28:42
applying okay and well basically guys it's
28:48
really right it really powerful right the this PR for you're going to get a
28:55
lot of fun with this so okay basically with that one you can be more than ready
29:01
for the exam maybe let's see a little bit about Theory
29:06
okay okay this one let me
29:13
see okay I think that this one is easier than the other one but it's also good
29:19
this problem five is also going to be um good let's see a little bit of the the
29:24
normal force always is perpendicular to the ground yes right remember that the normal force is always perpendicular
29:30
good so this is true okay and when a body is at rest or moving with constant
29:36
velocity is because the net force is different from zero right yes right well
29:42
it's that rest or moving with no rest or moving veloc constant velocity remember
29:48
that is when the sum of the forces is equal to zero right so this is force
29:54
right good okay friction Force always goes in the same direction as the moon
29:59
no it's always opposite instead of goes it's always opposite right so this is
30:07
false okay a static friction Force May variz from okay this is something I
30:14
didn't tell you what okay in this of the okay the static Force right the static
30:22
friction force it can change from zero to a maximum value
30:41
okay okay the this friction right it can be
30:47
the
30:56
static
31:08
no that will be the third Newton Law remember the third Newton Law is the one
31:13
of action and reaction right the first one is the what the
31:19
inertia okay the first Newton law says that if the resulting external forces are zero then we will have no
31:27
acceleration that's true remember [Music]
31:43
that okay good
31:56
okay
32:26
for
32:38
most likely right there will be a problem about getting the tension this
32:43
in this remember that you have to know how to solve a system of equations
32:50
right F right but you can use any right you can use elimination you can use uh
33:14
okay good at um what else what else okay so PR one and P four are
33:22
basically the key for getting a one in your partial exam that I think is going
33:27
to be
33:33
on and yes basically with that is more than enough for you to get a 100 but
33:40
remember that always the first step is to draw the three body diagram the second step is to start putting the
33:46
equations right the X the sum of the forces in X and the sum of the forces in y
33:55
and using a lot of algebra so if you want to do something in the weekend
34:02
maybe like get really solid in algebra guys because basically physics is
34:09
algebra so well at least the really basic physics is this one yes so okay
34:17
guys well I think that's it for today and start working in the homework if you
34:23
understand it at least for sure you should be able to do this
34:28
one and this one yeah for sure PR one and PR two you
34:34
already know um three and four okay let's see
34:46
because and four we are going to do some problem like those more in the classroom
34:51
right and we're going to practice a lot so in order that you can get it but before practicing physics prog guys
34:58
learn a lot of math like learn what you should like have learned before
35:11
right to be really stressful Prof so you still have one year right for getting
35:19
really solid really solid algebra that's what you need in order to success in in
35:25
engineering or in finance or economics Finance economics and Engineering you
35:31
need a lot of algebra okay guys I think that's it for today and see
35:39
you
